Sept. 11, 2024 â The FDA has launched an investigation of the potential exposure to heavy metals when using tampons, the agency announced Tuesday.
The move follows the publication earlier this year of concerning laboratory test results that detected the presence of more than a dozen metals in a variety of popular non-organic and organic tampon products. That small study was a combined effort by researchers from Columbia University, Michigan State University, and the University of California, Berkeley.Â
âWe want the public to know that before tampons can be legally sold in the U.S., they must meet FDA requirements for safety and effectiveness. Manufacturers must test the product and its component materials before, during, and after manufacturing,â the FDA wrote in theÂannouncementof its own upcoming study. âBefore a product is allowed onto the market, biocompatibility testing is undertaken by the manufacturing company, which is part of safety testing, and is reviewed by the FDA prior to market authorization.â
There will be two studies, the FDA said. One of the studies will involve laboratory tests to evaluate metals in tampons and potential exposure people may experience when using them. The other study will be a review of current research regarding the health effects of metals that may be found in tampons.
The earlier study, published in June by the journalÂEnvironment International,found levels of lead in every product the researchers tested and detectable levels of more than a dozen other metals like arsenic and cadmium.
The researchers tested 24 tampon products from a range of major brands as well as store brands. The tampons were purchased at stores and online between September 2022 and March 2023. Metal content tended to differ by whether or not a product was labeled as organic, the researchers reported. Lead concentrations were higher in non-organic tampons, and organic tampons had higher levels of arsenic.
There is no safe level of lead exposure, theÂU.S. Environmental Protection Agencysays, and the effects are cumulative throughout the course of life. The study authors noted that the average age that girls begin menstruation is 12 years old, and the onset of menopause occurs, on average, at age 51. One study mentioned by the researchers estimated that between 52% and 86% of people who menstruate use tampons.
The FDA plans a more expansive set of analyses than the earlier study, the agency announced.
âWhile the study found metals in some tampons, the study did not test whether metals are released from tampons when used. It also did not test for metals being released, absorbed into the vaginal lining, and getting into the bloodstream during tampon use,â the FDA announcement stated. âThe FDAâs laboratory study will measure the amount of metals that come out of tampons under conditions that more closely mimic normal use.â
The absorbent materials in tampons, like cotton, rayon, and viscose, are potential sources of the metals. Cotton plants are particularly known to readily take up metals from the soil, although there are other ways that metals may enter the products, like during the manufacturing process.
Exposure to metals found in the initial analysis can affect a range of body systems and processes, including the brain, the kidneys, the heart, blood, and the reproductive and immune systems.
The vagina, the researchers noted, is highly permeable and substances absorbed there do not get filtered for toxins, such as by being metabolized or passing through the liver, before entering the bodyâs circulatory system.
The FDA announcement did not specify a time frame for the completion of its investigation.
