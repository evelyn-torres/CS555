Oct. 3, 2024 â Ethan Weiss, MD, was already sold on intermittent fasting by the time he began studying it.Â
For 7 years, the cardiologist practiced a type of fasting known as time-restricted eating. He ate whatever he wanted each day from noon to 8 p.m., and he fasted the other 16 hours.Â
But once he started researching the topic, his thinking changed.Â
The University of California San Francisco researcher and his colleagues published aÂ12-weekÂstudy that foundÂno significant difference in weight lossbetween people who practiced time-restricted eating and those who ate a traditional breakfast, lunch, and dinner.Â
By then, Weiss was no longer following the diet or encouraging others to use it.Â
âIt worked OK for me at first,â he said. But his family, he added, âwas very happy I stopped. I am nicer now.â
Over the pastÂquarter-centuryas obesity rates rose,Âintermittent fastinghas emerged as one of the most popular diets in the U.S., thanks in part to research touting its extraordinary weight loss and health benefits.Â Just this week, aÂstudygrabbed headlines with the finding that time-restricted eating coupled with nutrition counseling led to greater reductions in body fat and better blood sugar control than nutrition counseling alone in adults with metabolic risk factors like belly fat and high blood pressure.Â Ina recent survey,about 13% of Americans on a diet reported using intermittent fasting.Â
The appeal is clear. You donât have to count calories, cut carbs, or eat like someone from a bygone era. In fact, you can eat whatever you want, as long as you consume it within a limited daily window.Â
âPeople like it because itâs so easy to incorporate into your lifestyle,â saidÂKrista Varady, PhD, a professor of nutrition at the University of Illinois Chicago whoâs studied intermittent fasting since 2005.
Her research shows that people who practice intermittent fasting usually eat less overall. In her 2024 study,Âpeople with obesitycut about 200 to 550 calories per dayÂ â without counting a single one.Â
That can lead to some serious weight loss, which often leads to meaningfulÂhealth improvements.Â
But other recent research shows mixed results.
One study from August found aÂheightened risk of cancer cell growth in micewhen they were refed after a fast.Â
Earlier in the year, a poster presentation at a scientific conference reportedÂhigher rates of diseases of the heart and blood vessels among people whose eating habits resembled intermittent fasting.Â
Does this mean fasting diets are dangerous? Thatâs a hard no, and weâll explain why in a moment. But despite what enthusiasts have long argued, they may not be uniquely effective for weight loss and disease prevention, either.
Fasting and Weight Loss
Fastingâs weight loss and health-promoting reputation was built on studies of mice.Â
Thatâs also where Varadyâs research began. But she and her colleagues quickly moved on to studying intermittent fasting in humans.Â
âMice are just not good models for fasting,â she said. âThey have really, really high metabolic rates. If you fast a mouse for a day, thatâs like fasting a human for a week.â
At first, Varady saw intermittent fasting as an improvement over more traditional approaches to dieting. âWhat I noticed was that people just really hated tracking calories all the time,â she said. âThey also didnât like having to restrict themselves every single day.â
Varady and her colleagues tested the effects of alternate-day fastingÂ â eating about 25% of their normal diet one day and whatever they wanted the next.
âBut then we slowly realized people also hate that diet,â she said. Thatâs when her research pivoted to the 16:8 approachÂ â 16 hours of fasting and 8 hours of eating. "It seemed like a natural progression to study the one people actually do.â
The results of those studies, which by now have included thousands of people, show a consistent pattern: Improvements in health markers and reductions in disease risk are driven by people eating less and losing weight.Â
âIf you donât lose weight, you donât see any health benefits,â she said.
Potential Health Risks
So what about those recent reports connecting intermittent fasting to health risks?Â
The first was a poster presentation at a scientific conference sponsored by the American Heart Association. (In other words, it was not a published study in a peer-reviewed journal.) It looked at self-reported nutrition data from a large sample of American adults and identified a very small groupÂ â just 414 out of more than 20,000Â â who said they completed all their meals within an 8-hour window.Â
Compared to people who reported eating windows of 12 to 16 hours, they were 91% more likely to die of heart disease during at least 8 years of follow-up.
No one could say if they accurately reported what and when they ate, whether they were demographically different from other people in the data set, or even if their eating pattern was a deliberate choice.
Despite those limitations, the American Heart Association promoted the presentationâs findings in aÂnews release, leading to extensive news coverage and aÂscathing responsefrom 34 nutrition scientists, including Varady.
The study linking intermittent fasting to a higher cancer risk was very different.Â
Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that, in mice,many of the health benefits donât actually come from fastingâ but rather from the refeeding after a fast. When mice ate again after a fast, their bodies activated stem cells to repair and regenerate damaged tissues. That repair process, which includes theÂremoval of damaged or dysfunctional cells, is considered a major benefit of intermittent fasting.
But there is a potential downside: Cancer cells were more likely to multiply during the refeeding periodÂ â at least among mice that were genetically engineered to be more cancer-prone.
How does that apply to a human who practices time-restricted eating or alternate-day fasting?Â
It doesnât.Â
âYou can find links to almost anything good and anything badâ with any diet, Weiss said. But he has yet to see any evidence thatÂintermittent fasting is harmful.Â
On the contrary, previous animal experiments have found aÂlower cancer risk linked to fasting.Â
And preliminary research in humans suggestsÂimprovements in metabolic health and brain functionwith 5:2 intermittent fastingÂ â eating normally for 5 days, and then restricting yourself to a single meal on the other 2 days.
In that study, people in the fasting group were compared to a matched group who ate what the authors described as a âhealthy living dietâ 7 days a week for 8 weeks. Both groups achieved the same metabolic benefits, while the 5:2 fasting group did slightly better in tests of thinking skills.
Fasting Myths
One challenge with any diet is separating myth from fact.Â
With fasting, for example, advocates will often say thatÂgoing long periods without foodwas a natural part of human evolutionary history. Thatâs true, and itâs why our bodies today areÂmetabolically flexibleÂ â we can function on just about any kind of food, or with no food at all.
But it doesnât follow that humans, ancient or modern, routinelychoseto go without food, beyond specific religious practices.Â
Duke University anthropology professorÂHerman Pontzer, PhD, has spent a lot of time with theÂHadza, a traditional hunter-gatherer community in Tanzania.
âMy observations don't align with the idea that extended fasts are a normal part of life,â Pontzer said. âIt's very rare that there's not something to eat.â
On the other side of that coin is the notion that fasting is so unnatural, it causes harm. Varady is sometimes asked to comment onÂfalse narratives.
Â âThe main one that really bothers me, and the one that gets a lot of traction on the internet, is that intermittent fasting messes up peopleâs reproductive hormones, particularly in women,â she said. âI donât know how that got started, but thereâs literally no research in humans showing any clinically significant changes in any hormone like estrogen.âÂ
Itâs part of a bigger challenge faced by nutrition scientists as well as doctors, nutritionists, and other practitioners.Â
âThe only thing people really listen to is random influencers on social media and what they think about intermittent fasting,â Varady said.Â
Another myth: Fasting gives people license to eat unhealthy foods during their feeding periods.Â
The idea seems intuitive, especially for more extreme versions of intermittent fasting. For example, if someone has just fasted for 24 hours, or if their feeding window is just 4 hours a day, youâd expect them to race to the drive-thru the minute that window opens.Â
âInterestingly, they donât,â Varady said. âPeople donât want to switch out all the foods in their pantries. So they eat the same foods, but less of them. We donât see any increases in sugar or saturated fat intake.â
How to Make IntermittentÂFasting Work for You
If you decide to try it, Varady recommends 16:8 intermittent fasting.Â
âThe 8-hour window is a good place to start,â she said. âIt results in some of the nicest weight loss weâve seen, and itâs one of the easiest to incorporate into someoneâs lifestyle.â
It also helps to go into it with realistic expectations.Â
âIntermittent fasting results in mild weight loss,â Varady saidÂ â basically what youâd expect from any diet. âIt just helps people eat less. Itâs not magical.â
