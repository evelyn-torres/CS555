Goodnutritionis the cornerstone ofhealthy aging. Yet as we age, our dietary requirements change. We usually donât need as many calories. But we have to be sure we get enough of certain keynutrients, likecalcium,vitamin B12, andvitamin D.
Getting propernutritionoften becomes harder with age because of things like loss of appetite or problems with chewing or swallowing food. Thatâs why itâs so important to talk to your doctor about nutrition. Here are questions you may want to ask.
Surveys show that many Americans, especially older Americans, arenât getting all thenutritionthey need.
Even many people who areoverweightfall short onvitamins, minerals, and othernutrients. They get plenty of calories, but they may not be getting enough nutrition. Unfortunately, a long-term lack of nutrients may happen before symptoms show up.
Early signs of this may include:
Aphysical exammay alert your doctor to poor nutrition.Bloodtests can show whether you get enough of some key nutrients, such as iron orvitamin D.
A range ofmedicines, including many often used by older adults, can interfere with good nutrition.
Some pain relievers andarthritismeds irritate thestomach, for example. Someantibiotics, stool softeners, andchemotherapydrugs can affect how food tastes.Antidepressants,diuretics, painmedications, and someheartdrugs can lower your appetite.
A variety of treatments can stifle the bodyâs ability to absorbvitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. These includechemotherapy,radiation therapy, and medications.
There are many reasons why older adults often donât have a big appetite. Because they are usually less active than younger people, they need fewer calories. And less ability to taste may mean that food just doesnât have as much appeal as it once did.
However, a big loss of appetite or weight loss can also be a sign ofdepressionor other serious health problems. Tell your doctor if you see a change in your appetite or lose weight without trying.
Experts disagree about whether older Americans should take multivitamins. Most nutritionists agree that the best way to get your nutrients is from food, not pills.
If you have trouble eating a balanced diet, ask your doctor whether you should take a multivitamin. Be sure to let your doctor know about all pills you take, includingsupplements.
Some people may need to take additionalsupplementsof certain nutrients.
For example, if you donât eat foods rich incalcium, like dairy products, you may need a supplement. Talk to your doctor before taking any pills.
If you havehighblood pressure, or even if yourblood pressureis at the high end of normal, try cutting back on salt.
The AmericanHeartAssociation recommends everyone have less than 1,500 milligrams of sodium a day. They estimate that if people did this, it would result in a 25% drop inhigh blood pressureacross the country.
Up to three-quarters of the salt we eat comes in packaged foods, so reading labels is particularly helpful.
Moderate amounts of alcohol reduce the risk ofheart disease.
This doesnât mean you should start drinking. But if you already drink alcohol, talk to your doctor about a safe level for you. Drinking too much can lead to serious health problems.
Many older people can cut back on blood pressure,cholesterol, or other medications if they eat a healthier diet and get moreexercise. Some discover they can go off certain prescription drugs completely.
Talk to your doctor about whether a healthier lifestyle could mean taking fewer pills. Donât stop taking medicines on your own.
Even though doctors understand the importance of a healthy diet, they often donât have time to provide complete dietary counseling. If you have more questions than your doctor has time to answer, ask them to recommend a registered dietitian.Medicareand private insurers often cover nutrition consultations.
