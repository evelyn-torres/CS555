But women who have risk factors forcervical cancersuch as smoking, a history of HPV, or a more advanced precancer diagnosis should continue to be screened.

Itâs not a normal part of aging, and you can get treatment. If you're feeling sad, hopeless, or not interested in things you used to enjoy, talk with your doctor. They can see if you're depressed by having you fill out a questionnaire or by asking you a few simple questions.
