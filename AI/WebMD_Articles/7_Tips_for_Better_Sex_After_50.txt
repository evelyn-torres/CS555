Before you reconnect with your partner, give your body time to recover. Once you have your doctor's OK, start slowly with sensual touch and kissing.
Speak honestly with your partner about how you're feeling, both physically and emotionally.
Talk openly with your partner if you have any concerns about your sex life, whether itâs about your changing desires or how you feel about your body.
If youâre both unhappy with where your sex life is and havenât been able to work it out, you might want to talk with a sex therapist. Your doctor should be able to give you a referral.
And remember, some older couples find their sex lives are actually better as theyâve aged. You may find you have more time and privacy, plus you can have moreintimacywith a long-time partner.
STDscan still happen:You might think ofsexually transmitted diseases, orSTDs, as a younger personâs problem. But age is zero protection fromHIV,syphilis,genital herpes, and other STDs.
You need to take the same precautions about unprotected sex as anyone else if you have more than one partner.
When to see a doctor:Our bodies do go through changes as we age that might affect our sex lives.
After menopause, some women might havevaginal dryness. It can make intercourse painful. You may need to talk with your partner about more foreplay or try a silicone-based lubricant. If itâs still a problem, talk to your doctor.
Some men might find they need more stimulation to get and keep an erection. This kind of change is normal. Try to relax and enjoy your partnerâs touch. But if you have an ongoing ED problem, it might be time to visit a doctor.
People of either sex might have body image problems, recalling how they looked in their younger days. These thoughts shouldnât keep you from enjoying sex. If they do, perhaps a sex therapist can help.
