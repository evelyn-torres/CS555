        "Goodnutritionis the cornerstone ofhealthy aging. Yet as we age, our dietary requirements change. We usually donât need as many calories. But we have to be sure we get enough of certain keynutrients, likecalcium,vitamin B12, andvitamin D.\nGetting propernutritionoften becomes harder with age because of things like loss of appetite or problems with chewing or swallowing food. Thatâs why itâs so important to talk to your doctor about nutrition. Here are questions you may want to ask.\nSurveys show that many Americans, especially older Americans, arenât getting all thenutritionthey need.\nEven many people who areoverweightfall short onvitamins, minerals, and othernutrients. They get plenty of calories, but they may not be getting enough nutrition. Unfortunately, a long-term lack of nutrients may happen before symptoms show up.\nEarly signs of this may include:\nAphysical exammay alert your doctor to poor nutrition.Bloodtests can show whether you get enough of some key nutrients, such as iron orvitamin D.\nA range ofmedicines, including many often used by older adults, can interfere with good nutrition.\nSome pain relievers andarthritismeds irritate thestomach, for example. Someantibiotics, stool softeners, andchemotherapydrugs can affect how food tastes.Antidepressants,diuretics, painmedications, and someheartdrugs can lower your appetite.\nA variety of treatments can stifle the bodyâs ability to absorbvitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. These includechemotherapy,radiation therapy, and medications.\nThere are many reasons why older adults often donât have a big appetite. Because they are usually less active than younger people, they need fewer calories. And less ability to taste may mean that food just doesnât have as much appeal as it once did.\nHowever, a big loss of appetite or weight loss can also be a sign ofdepressionor other serious health problems. Tell your doctor if you see a change in your appetite or lose weight without trying.\nExperts disagree about whether older Americans should take multivitamins. Most nutritionists agree that the best way to get your nutrients is from food, not pills.\nIf you have trouble eating a balanced diet, ask your doctor whether you should take a multivitamin. Be sure to let your doctor know about all pills you take, includingsupplements.\nSome people may need to take additionalsupplementsof certain nutrients.\nFor example, if you donât eat foods rich incalcium, like dairy products, you may need a supplement. Talk to your doctor before taking any pills.\nIf you havehighblood pressure, or even if yourblood pressureis at the high end of normal, try cutting back on salt.\nThe AmericanHeartAssociation recommends everyone have less than 1,500 milligrams of sodium a day. They estimate that if people did this, it would result in a 25% drop inhigh blood pressureacross the country.\nUp to three-quarters of the salt we eat comes in packaged foods, so reading labels is particularly helpful.\nModerate amounts of alcohol reduce the risk ofheart disease.\nThis doesnât mean you should start drinking. But if you already drink alcohol, talk to your doctor about a safe level for you. Drinking too much can lead to serious health problems.\nMany older people can cut back on blood pressure,cholesterol, or other medications if they eat a healthier diet and get moreexercise. Some discover they can go off certain prescription drugs completely.\nTalk to your doctor about whether a healthier lifestyle could mean taking fewer pills. Donât stop taking medicines on your own.\nEven though doctors understand the importance of a healthy diet, they often donât have time to provide complete dietary counseling. If you have more questions than your doctor has time to answer, ask them to recommend a registered dietitian.Medicareand private insurers often cover nutrition consultations.\nSOURCES:Â\nAlice H.

        "Theyâre called the golden years for a reason. Getting older has its perks. For one, youâre good at using what youâve learned. This is called crystalized intelligence, and it keeps getting better, even when youâre 65 or 70.\nTurns out you might not be a grumpy old man (or woman), after all. Youâll probably get more agreeable as you age, at least through your 60s. Youâre also likely to be happier and less inclined to get angry. Scientists havenât figured out exactly why this happens, but they do have some theories. Older people might control their emotions better, and focus more on how to make the most of life.\nYouâre more in tune with other peopleâs emotions in your 40s than at any other time in your life.Â  That insight into how others think and feel can make living with your loved ones easier and help you get along better with your coworkers, too.\nOlder women may have sex less often than when they were younger, but apparently they make it count. In a study of women 40 and over, researchers found that sexual satisfaction improved with age. Women over 80 were more likely than those between 55 and 79 to say they were satisfied during sex.\nAs you age, medications, illness (colds,flu, gum diseases, etc.) and allergies all can change your sense of smell and taste. And that can affect your diet and health. If you find things need to be spiced up, try some olive oil, herbs likerosemaryandthyme,garlic,onion, peppers, or mustard. Just stay away from the salt.\nAround the time the hair on your head starts to disappear, it can show up in the strangest places. This can mean large hairs in older guys' noses and ears. Older women may notice small hairs on their chins. This is all caused by changes in our hormones.\nThereâs a good chance youâll become the morning person youâve always wanted to be -- in your 60s. Our sleeping patterns can shift as we age, so we get sleepier earlier and wake up earlier. That seems to work out well. One study showed that even though folks over 65 tend to wake up during the night, most said they regularly get agood nightâs sleep.\nOnce you hit your 70s, thosemigrainesÂ you may have had much of your life may go away. Only 10% of women and 5% of men over 70 still report migraines. Even better news: If you do have amigraine, it may not actually come with theheadache. As people age, some may experience migraines as visual or sensory disturbances without pain.\nEarly retirement might not be the best thing for your health -- unless you have a fun second career. A study called the Longevity Project found that people who work hard at a job they enjoy live the longest. That, along with goodfriendsand a good marriage, could be the key to sticking around a while.\nYou may worry more about breaking bones as you age. One study found that about a third of adults over 65 have that fear. And itâs understandable, because falls are the leading cause of injuries for older people.\nSelf-esteem soars as you age, studies show, and increases with wealth, education, good health, and employment. But it takes a dip after 60. That may be because people begin to have health issues and start searching for a new sense of purpose following retirement. With increasing life spans, healthier lifestyles, and working to an older age, we may see that change.\nBaby boomers and older adults report less stress than their younger counterparts, according to the American Psychological Associationâs annual Stress in America report. That doesnât mean, it goes away. Health and money problems still crop up. But, the APA says, 9 of 10 older adults say theyâre doing enough to manage it.\nThe longer youâre alive, the more gravity brings you down. The spaces between the bones in your spine -- called vertebrae -- get closer together. That can make you about an inch shorter as you get older.\nThe graying of America may be a good thing for you. Those 60 and over tend to cast ballots more than any other age group. And theyâre the fastest-growing block of voters in the U.S. these days. That means more voting power on topics that matter as you age such as Medicare, Social Security, and health care\nIMAGES PROVIDED BY:\n1) Jose Luis Pelaez Inc / Getty Images\n2) Sam Edwards / Getty Images\n3) altrendo images / Thinkstock\n4) FlairImages / Thinkstock\n5) Cathy Yeulet / Thinkstock\n6) Gpointstudio / Getty Images\n7) Keith Brofsky / Thinkstock\n8) g-stockstudio / Thinkstock\n9) michaeljung / Thinkstock\nSOURCES:\nAmerican Journal of Medicine: âSexual Activity and Satisfaction in Healthy Community-dwelling Older Women.â\nAmerican Psychological Association: âPersonality changes for the better with age,â âThe real secrets to a longer life.â\nHarvard Gazette: âSmarter by the minute, sort of.â\nJohns Hopkins Medical Library: âIntroduction to Menopause.â\nKidsHealth.org: âWhy Do People Shrink?â\nNational Sleep Foundation: âInsomnia & Older Adults.â\nOregon Technology in Education Council: âTheories of Intelligence.â\nScientific American: âHow do hairs like those on the chest or in the nose know to grow when you trim them?â\nU.S. National Library of Medicine: âPhysiological changes in scalp, facial and body hair after menopause: a cross-sectional population-based study of subjective changes.â\nÂ© 2005 - 2024 WebMD LLC, anInternet Brandscompany.

        "As you age, some conditions or medicines may put a damper on your sex drive and performance.

They can make your pelvic floor muscles stronger. You can identify those muscles the next time you pee by stopping in midstream. You can practice tightening and relaxing those muscles several times a day.\nMen who exercise are less likely to have problems witherectile dysfunction, or ED, than men who are inactive. If you enjoy long-distance bicycling, make sure you have a soft, comfortable seat and a bike that fits you properly. This can help you avoid a potential ED problem.\nBe sure to talk to your doctor before you begin any newexercise program.\nWhen youâve been with the same partner for a long time, you may want to come up with ideas to add a little variety to your sex life.\nThe answer might be something as simple as changing the time of day you have sex. If youâre too sleepy at night, maybe sex in the morning is right for both of you.\nSome other ideas to keep things interesting:\nIf you or your partner canât do this anymore, there are other options for you to enjoy closeness and pleasure.\nThe simple but intimate acts ofkissingand touching should not be overlooked.

Ahead of time, take a warm bath or some pain medicine if you need it so that you'll be more relaxed.\nThe side effects of somemedicationscan cause sexual problems. Some that can do this include:\nIf you have reason to suspect that any of your meds are dampening your sex life, talk with your doctor.\nBefore you reconnect with your partner, give your body time to recover. Once you have your doctor's OK, start slowly with sensual touch and kissing.\nSpeak honestly with your partner about how you're feeling, both physically and emotionally.\nTalk openly with your partner if you have any concerns about your sex life, whether itâs about your changing desires or how you feel about your body.\nIf youâre both unhappy with where your sex life is and havenât been able to work it out, you might want to talk with a sex therapist. Your doctor should be able to give you a referral.\nAnd remember, some older couples find their sex lives are actually better as theyâve aged. You may find you have more time and privacy, plus you can have moreintimacywith a long-time partner.\nSTDscan still happen:You might think ofsexually transmitted diseases, orSTDs, as a younger personâs problem. But age is zero protection fromHIV,syphilis,genital herpes, and other STDs.\nYou need to take the same precautions about unprotected sex as anyone else if you have more than one partner.\nWhen to see a doctor:Our bodies do go through changes as we age that might affect our sex lives.\nAfter menopause, some women might havevaginal dryness. It can make intercourse painful. You may need to talk with your partner about more foreplay or try a silicone-based lubricant.

        "Sound Body, Sound Mind\nWhen caring for an older adult, it's important not to overlook routine care -- stuff that seems obvious but that may not be on your radar. Here is a rundown of what to keep in mind.\nEveryone needs regular checkups. But some older adults (and young ones, too) reason that since they just saw the doctor last month about thatsinusproblem, they don't need to go again. A visit to the doctor for a specific problem, however, doesn't take the place of a complete checkup.\nMake sure your parent is eating a balanced diet. Accompany them to the market to guide shopping choices, teach how to read labels, and discuss the importance of all the food groups, vitamins, fiber, andcalcium.\nID jewelry with pertinent medical alert and contact information should be worn by all older adults. There is a huge variety of bracelets, pendants, and even watchbands available. One company that sells them isAmerican Medical Identifications.\nKnow your mother's baseline -- what's \"normal\" for them. Some older adults have a lower normal body temperature than 98.6 degrees Farenheit, and others have had chronic problems throughout their lives. Be familiar with Mom's \"default setting,\" and be aware of changes. Know that baselines change as a person ages. If, for instance, they goÂ through surgery, chances are they will come out of it with a new baseline.\nKnow your loved one's complete medical history and keep a record of it to be taken to doctor's appointments and checked often. Just as important is to know your own medical history, in case genetic issues arise or transplants or transfusions become necessary.\nUnless told otherwise by your doctor, you should each be drinking eight glasses of water a day. Did you know thatdehydrationis a common cause of many disorders in older adults, including circulation problems? Make sure liquids are available all day long. How about an attractive thermos for the bedside or a water cooler in the living room and on the patio? Get one on casters so it can be moved from room to room.\nBlood pressure is an issue among most older adults. Get a reliable sphygmomanometer (a blood pressure monitor) and teach your loved one -- and yourself -- to takeblood pressure readings. Some pharmacies take blood pressure readings and teach you to do it yourself for free.\nLocal community service organizations such as the Kiwanis or Lions Club often offer freeeye examsandeyeglassesto older adults who can't easily afford them. Your Area Agency on Aging will tell you what's available in your area.\nFree dental care is available from local dental schools, and often, a low income is not even a requirement. Contact the dental college in your area.\nKeep a diary of your parent's health progress.\nIf your loved one is running a temperature or experiencing any other condition that may require a doctor's care, keep hourly notes and temperature readings for later reference.\nWash your handsoften when caring for your parents. Remind them to wash theirs, too.\nKeep plenty of moisturizer around. Dry, chapped hands are especially common in winter. When you visit department stores, ask the people at thecosmeticscounters for free samples, and keep these around the house to be used often.\nEven naturalsupplementscan sometimes be a bad mix with certainmedicationsor cause side effects on their own. Ask your mom if they are taking anything like herbs or othersupplements. Check them out with their doctor, no matter how harmless you believe they are.\nFoot massagers are great for promotingbloodcirculation and avoiding cracked heals, which can sometimes split. This is especially important in people with diabetes.\nA digital thermometer is easier to use than a mercury thermometer. Take temperatures using thearmpitif your parent hasbreathing problemsor is easily confused.\nIf Mom has breathing problems and uses an inhaler, keep several around your house and hers, in the car, and so forth.\nMany trips to the bathroom may indicate aurinary tract infection, common among older people who don't always get the fluids they need. Consult a doctor immediately.\nConsult a podiatrist immediately for corns,calluses,bunions,blisters, sores, and infections, or ingrown, hard, brittle, split, or discolored toenails. If your senior has problem feet, a weekly trip to a salon for apedicuremakes a great outing. Most salons have special discount days for older adults. Don't forget to ask about these.\nKeep a checklist -- a \"report card\" -- and update it periodically to keep track of how your parent is doing with meal preparation, housework, mobility (in and out of the house), laundry, shopping, money issues, medications, bathing, dressing, and eating. These are key activities of daily living (ADLs), and difficulty with them indicates there may be trouble.\nIf your parent or parents live in a multilevel home but has problems with stairs, consider a chair lift. They are not inexpensive, but they can be cheaper than moving and will help keep your parent independent for a longer time. For someone who sits a lot, an ergonomic chair that offers greater lumbar support and adjustable features (chair height, armrest height, seat depth) can make a huge difference in overall health. Ergonomic chairs come in all kinds of models and varying prices.\nIf an ergonomic chair is not an option, make sure your father's chair has an adjustable height feature, the seat depth is approximately two-thirds the length of their thighs and buttocks, the back is at least fourteen inches high, and the armrests are no more than nine inches high.\nBad posture can complicate back problems and limit mobility. Is Mom walking as upright as they used to? Is Dad favoring one leg over the other for some reason? Sometimes the answer can be as simple as a new pair of shoes.\nOsteoporosis is a serious problem for older women, leading to height changes and serious (sometimes deadly)fractures. Schedule your parent for abone density test, and encourage weight-bearing exercise (walking, light weights, gardening). Make sure Mom gets plenty ofcalcium(the new \"chocolatechew\"supplementsare delicious), and ask their doctor abouthormone replacement therapyor other treatments.\nMake sure Mom has amammogramannually.\nIf there are precautionary measures that must be remembered, make a checklist and post it in a place where it can't possibly be missed. But change the list and its location from time to time so that it doesn't get taken for granted after a while. If you use a dry erase board or a chalkboard, ask your parent to check off the points as they are followed.\nThe older you get, the more you are affected by alcohol. On the other hand, a glass of wine now and then has been known to be beneficial for theheart. Check with your loved one's doctor for a good rule of thumb. In the meantime, locate some \"zero-proof\" recipes and dress them up -- tiny umbrellas and all -- for a special or even not-so-special occasion.\nDon't minimize changes in your parents' health, even if they seem minor. These changes may be accompanied by fear, which can exacerbate even a minor problem. Address your parents' fears; be positive about your ability to find a solution.\nAnemiais very common among older adults, usually resulting from either a loss ofbloodor a poor diet. Check with the doctor as to whetheriron supplements(taken with orange juice or withvitamin Cfor better absorption) might be in order.\nHelp prevent infections by keeping antibacterial wet wipes handy at all times. Keep boxes of them around the house; individually wrapped ones can go in your purse or wallet and in the car.\nAvoid footfungusby keeping feet clean and dry. That means changing socks daily and shoes often. It's also a good idea to let feet \"air out\" once a day.\nNylon or synthetic socks are more likely to make feet sweat. Cotton is better.\nIf socks are too tight at the tops, they can interfere with circulation. Cut notches into them to make sure they don't bind.\nTeach your loved one to respect pain. If something hurts, there's a reason for it.\nBedsores -- or pressure sores -- result when there is constant pressure on an area where bones are close to theskin's surface. Be on the lookout for problems in these most vulnerable areas: the back of the head, the shoulder blades, the elbows, the base of the spine, the hips, the heels, and theankles. Consult a doctor if you see red, cracking, or dried skin. In the meantime, encourage Dad to move about when they can, and don't leave them sitting or lying on a damp surface. Make sure linens are not irritating, and wash them often.\nAlways wear (disposable) rubber gloves when you suspect you might have any kind of skin disorder, such as arash, an infection, or a lesion of any type.\nIt's a good idea to accompany your mother to the supermarket occasionally to point out new products and to make sure they are shopping wisely. Encourage them to read labels for salt content, sugar, and other health considerations. If they resist, urge them to at least heed fat content. Generally, none of us should be taking in more than 30% of our daily calorie intake in the form of fat, and of that, no more than 10% should come from saturated fats. Olive oil is a good source of unsaturated fat.\nFrozen foods, which are processed right after they are harvested, often retain more vitamins than \"fresh\" vegetables, which may sit on shelves for days before getting to the supermarket.\nWhen ordering packaged meals from local agencies, ask for extra vegetables. Also, consider supplementing the meal with a homemade side dish.\nWould a small refrigerator or a mini microwave in the bedroom or family room make it easier for Dad to have nutritious snacks all day long?\nIf shopping is a problem, maybe you can fit an extra freezer in Mom's home somewhere that will allow them to stock up.\nDoes your grandfather need help with cooking? ContactMeals on Wheels of Americato find a local program that will deliver free meals to their home. All adults older than sixty are eligible. Note that Meals on Wheels doesn't deliver on weekends, so you'll have to make other arrangements. Can a neighbor help? How about a local church or other religious organization? Or ask a local favorite restaurant to deliver a couple of meals.\nIf your father has vision problems, put liquid in a see-through cup or glass so they can see the liquid.\nIf your mother's on a special diet, write the day's menu on a blackboard and ask them to check each item off as it's consumed.\nFax a weekly shopping list to your parent's local market and ask for it to be delivered. You can even pay for it over the phone with your credit card.\nFind easy recipes that allow your parent to cook with canned and packaged foods -- they combine quickly and are quite tasty. There are a variety of cookbooks in this category. Mom might enjoyDesperation Dinners, by Beverly Mills and Alicia Ross; for Dad, how aboutA Man, a Can, a Plan, by David Joachim.\nThere are cookbooks available with easy recipes suitable for special diets (diabetes, heart disease), cooking for one, or microwave cooking. Browse the bookstore or search Amazon.com for the one that will suit your parents' tastes.\nWhen you call, casually ask your parent to tell you what they have been eating. \"What did you have for dinner last night?\" is better than \"How's your appetite?\"\nIf Mom is passing up making the meals they once loved because \"it's just one person,\" get them a small wok and a cooking-for-one cook-book. Schedule visits at mealtimes so they'll have an excuse to cook.\nIf asked, the grocer might break up packages to sell smaller quantities to your parent, like a half-dozen eggs, two potatoes, or just a few slices of bread (the grocer can use the rest of the loaf to make sandwiches).\nUltra-pasteurized milk that comes in cardboard cartons has a very long shelf life. Just make sure your parent chills it before drinking and refrigerates it after it's opened.\nIf your loved one takes a long time to eat, arrange for them to start their meal before everyone else.\nBe especially patient at mealtimes; older adults often eat much more slowly than what you may be used to. Try to minimize distractions at mealtimes, and don't bring up stressful subjects.\nA person who is easily confused might have an easier mealtime if you serve one course at a time and clear each one away before serving the next.\nA solid-color tablecloth, as opposed to a patterned one, will minimize mealtime distractions.\nMaybe your parent or grandparent just hates eating in the kitchen. Try moving to the dining room or even a space outdoors.\nDon't ever wrap dentures in napkins, assuming you will retrieve them after the meal. Chances are they'll be thrown out.\nFreeze small containers of your leftovers from home to share with your parent. Label them with the date and contents.\nFreeze sauces, soups, and bouillon in ice cube trays so that individual servings can be popped out and heated.\nMake sure that your parent or grandparent has access to lots of healthy, easy-to-eat snacks, such as berries, bagels, pitas, cheese, raisins, crackers, energy bars, or apple, melon, or orange slices.\nIf Mom's appetite is lagging, find out if they have a taste or yen for something special. Experiment with old recipes to make them more palatable and \"legal\" (use lactose-free milk, salt and sugar substitutes, ground meat instead of cubed, or yogurt instead of cream, but first consult a doctor about the interaction of these substitutes with any medications). There are tons of books on the subject and most have recipes. Consult them.\nIf your loved one is having trouble gaining or maintaining weight, pack their diet with liquid calories. Fruit juices, milk, and milk alternatives such as soy, rice, and nut milks are high in nutrients and calories and are much less filling than solid foods. Smoothies, yogurt shakes, and protein drinks are a little more filling, but may still make a good meal alternative.\nRespect your father's tastes. If they haveÂ hated yogurt all their life, don't start feeding it to them now just because they are less able to resist.\nA water filter makes a great gift for an older parent or grandparent.\nFour or five smaller meals during the day can be more manageable than three large ones. This approach has the added benefit of keeping blood sugar levels more even throughout the day.\nIf your parent has vision problems, use the \"clock\" method of serving food: the main dish is right in front of them at \"six o'clock,\" the starch dish is farthest and directly opposite at \"twelve o'clock,\" and so on.\nWhen family and friends call and ask what gift they can bring, suggest prepared foods. (If your parent gets Meals on Wheels deliveries, save the goodies for the weekend.)\nUse plastic bibs at mealtime.\nIt's OK to bring a special meal to a restaurant for your parent and ask to have it microwaved for you, just as long as everyone else is ordering off the menu. Waiters and waitresses want to help you; tell them what you need privately, to avoid embarrassment. And a good chef, if they are not too busy, can accommodate anyone. Show your appreciation, and tip accordingly.\nDry food can be difficult to swallow. Use sauces generously, but learn to make healthy versions.\nUse flexible straws.\nFor those who refuse regular meals, keep healthy snacks (fruits, nutritious cookies, cut-up vegetables) available around the house. Finger foods are best. Be creative -- but not overbearing -- in your coaxing efforts.\nTry using children's non-spill cups with covers or sports drink containers with a straw.\nMake mealtime more special by using fancy plates and napkins.\nFor some, it's easier to cut food with scissors than a knife and fork.\nIf Mom can't cut their meat any longer, avoid embarrassment by cutting it for them in the kitchen before you serve.\nSoft and pureed foods don't have to be bland and tasteless. Find out which herbs and spices make an otherwise bland dish interesting. You might also serve the following in colorful combinations:\nBaby food is great if you need to get a meal together in a hurry. The fruit selections are delicious!\nGet a copy ofThe Non-Chew Cookbook, by Randy J. Wilson.\nNo one likes to eat alone. If Mom insists that you partake of their bland, pureed diet, consider bringing along your own snacks at mealtime.\nToo many items on the table can be confusing. Keep condiments to a minimum.\nFreely make use of microwaveable prepackaged foods. You can stock up on them and put them in the freezer after marking each with the day of the week when it should be eaten.\nIf your loved one can't swallow thin liquids, someone has probably recommended Thick-It, a tasteless powder that thickens hot and cold liquids. The canister is bulky, so keep small supplies of Thick-It in your bag to use on outings. If Dad's not supposed to drink unthickened liquid, don't cheat, not even \"just this once.\"\nOlder adults should always eat sitting up.\nTake your parent to lunch, even if you're at work. Call at lunchtime, and you can eat together -- you at the desk, they at home in the kitchen. But remember that it's dangerous for an older person (or anyone else) to talk while chewing.\nYour parent's peak period of digestion (when it's easiest to digest food) is midday. Plan the large meal for that time of day, and keep supper light.\nWhen feeding your father, only put one teaspoon of food in their mouth at once. Alternate spoonfuls of solids and liquids.\nPlan your mother's weekly menu ahead of time so shopping for all meals can be done at once. Copy their recipes onto cards and write the shopping list for each dish on the backs. Take the cards with you when you go shopping.\nOlder adults who seem to have endless appetites often forget they have just eaten. Put stickers on the clock for mealtimes so they can see how long it is until the next meal. Making small nutritious snacks available throughout the day is also helpful.\nYour parent should never lie down right after a meal -- that is the most common cause of indigestion. (Eating too fast is the second most common cause.) Make sure Mom sits or stands for at least an hour after they eat.\nMany medications leave an awful taste in the mouth that is far worse than anything you can imagine. They can make sugar taste like salt, and some favorite foods become completely inedible. Be especially patient during this time as you try new things to see what works. In the meantime, a lollipop may help your loved one after they haveÂ eaten something distasteful. (Don't give sucking candies to anyone who might easily swallow them whole.)\nYou can get someone to come to the house just to feed meals to your parent. Contact your Area Agency on Aging.\nEven if Mom isn't making use of the local senior center, they can attend every day just for meals. If salt is an issue, there are a bunch of flavorful seasoning substitutes on the market.\nThere are tons of special utensils that can make eating a lot easier; a combination fork and knife for one-handed eating, a tilted spoon for someone with hand problems, or a two-handled mug for easier drinking are available from the many suppliers of special-needs items. You can also buy plate guards that keep food from sliding off.B Independentoffers a wide range of such products.\nJews, Christians, Sikhs, Muslims, and Hindus all incorporate fasting into various rituals and celebrations. If your parent is observant, but you suspect they may not be physically up to the fast, speak to their doctor or spiritual counselor, who can talk to them about reasonable exemptions from fasting.\nDiet supplementslike Ensure are widely used in hospitals and nursing homes. Keep them cooled. Put a few cans on ice in the morning, and make them available all day long.\nA glass of wine, if it's allowed by your Mom's doctor, can stimulate the appetite.\nIf Grandma has trouble sleeping (and is not bedridden), encourage them to spend as little \"awake time\" as possible in bed. Reading, watching TV, and so forth, should be done in a favorite chair, while bed is for sleep only. Going to sleep and waking up at about the same time each day will also help train their body for better sleep overall.\nOlder adults should avoid oversleeping in the morning. It leads to having trouble falling asleep later, and the cycle of insomnia begins.\nIf Dad can't fall asleep within fifteen minutes of getting into bed, suggest them to get up for a while and do something calming, and then try again later.\nDon't take sleep disruption lightly. It can be caused by an improper dose of medication, an illness, or a psychological problem. Talk about it with your loved one's doctor. Many drugs, including Halcion and even the antidepressants that are supposed to make their life better, can cause terrifying nightmares.\nIf your father wakes with night terrors, be reassuring. Show them that there's no danger nearby, but avoid arguing. If they insistÂ that something (or someone) woke them, let them know that whatever the trouble was, it's gone now.\nPeople of any age who have difficulty sleeping should avoid exercise in the late afternoon and evening. Try morning walks instead.\nAvoid caffeine, not just in the evening but at any time of day. Aside from coffee, tea, and cola, look out for caffeine in chocolate, non-cola soft drinks, and some pain relievers. And while decaffeinated coffee has less caffeine than regular, it's not caffeine-free.\nAlcohol can make your senior drowsy at first, but it hurts healthy sleep in the long run by disturbing the sleep cycle, making sleep less restful, and making them more likely to wake up during the night.\nAs with practically everything, \"A good laugh and a long sleep are the two best cures.\"\nMaintain a sleep diary to note sleep patterns. The doctor will find this information useful if you need to consult with her, and you might discover patterns you weren't aware of: Is sleeping a problem the night before the family comes to visit? Is this about anxiety or excitement? Visit theNational Sleep Foundationfor more information.\nIf there are serious issues that require discussion, don't bring these up right before bedtime. Avoid arguments.\nSome people swear by a teaspoon of honey in a cup of hot water before bedtime. Others go for warm milk with a little cinnamon. But if liquids are a problem before bed, find a different solution. A foot bath or massage right before bed can help.\nGet dark-lined (blackout) shades for people who don't sleep well, and block out disturbing noise with a fan or a white noise machine. Some models have a choice of sounds that mimic ocean waves, the patter of raindrops, and other soothing sounds.\nAromatherapy using lavender candles and potpourri can be very relaxing. Try a couple drops of lavender oil in a bath or on the corner of your parent's pillow. You can even buy soft microwavable products that warm up potpourri inside.\nChange the linens often. Everyone enjoys fresh sheets. You can even buy lavender water to put in the wash. It's sold in a lot of home stores and catalogs these days.\nUnpleasant odors can interfere with sleep. Use potpourri and make sure the air in the room has a chance to circulate. When Mom's out of the room for a while, open the windows or light a scented candle.\nCreate a sleep ritual before bedtime and follow this every evening. If you live far away, you can still call at bedtime to wish your parents sweet dreams.\nCotton pajamas and sheets are less irritating than synthetics.\nRestless leg syndrome is a condition in which one leg or both legs experience nervous sensations that cause excessive movement. It's a fairly common condition that can often be treated with medication, iron supplements, and exercise. Is this what's keeping your loved one awake? Find out more online and talk to your doctor.\nDoes Dad's snoring rock the house? Is Grandma really sleepy in the morning and drowsy during the day? They may have sleep apnea, a disorder in which the person stops breathing at points during sleep. Consistent loud snoring, observed episodes of not breathing, and morning and daytime sleepiness are some of the warning signs. Men, people who are over forty, and people who are overweight are all at higher risk, but anyone can have it, and it's more common than diabetes. Sleep apnea can lead to insomnia, high blood pressure, weight gain, headaches, memory problems, excessive drowsiness, depression, impotence -- the list goes on.\nMake sure the mattress your father sleeps on is comfortable and right for them. Soft beds are nice, but maybe they needÂ more support. It's easier to rise from a firm mattress.\nSome people are just not morning people. If getting your parent up every morning is a problem and you already have enough to do at that hour, let them stay in bed until midmorning, if they like, and get them up after the family has gone off to work and school.\nWhile it may be tempting to take naps, they should be avoided if they interfere with getting a good night's sleep.\nArrange calming activities before bedtime; this is a time for reading, soft music, and soothing conversation. Have your loved one spend some time in pajamas before settling in to sleep.\nSaying prayers together before bedtime can be a wonderful ritual.\nMaybe Mom can't sleep because they have issues they can't talk about. Try to discuss this with them, or suggest they discuss the problem with another member of the family or a professional.\nRemind your senior to go to the bathroom before going to sleep. If they getÂ up often at night to go to the bathroom, suggest that they don't drink any liquids for three or four hours before bedtime. On the other hand, don't skimp too much on fluids during the day because you want to cut down on bathroom visits. Older adults often become dehydrated, which leads to painful (but common) urinary tract infections.\nLearn sleep techniques and teach them to your senior:\nA baby monitor will alert you to any nighttime problems your parent may be having, and they will feel secure knowing that if they callÂ in the middle of the night, you will hear them. Show them how the monitor works.\nIf it's the bed that's keeping your father awake, consider getting a hospital bed. Medicare will pay for it if their doctor recommends it.\nA foam \"egg crate\" mattress will help prevent bedsores and can be purchased from any medical supply house.\nRotate a new mattress once a month the first year and every season (four times a year) after that. A mattress should be replaced every eight to ten years.\nIf they sleep in the same bed but Mom needs a firm mattress and Dad prefers something softer, consider getting two single beds and moving them next to each other. You can use king- or queen-sized bedding, so it looks like one bed. This allows many couples to feel comfortable without giving up intimacy.\nA clock with brightly illuminated numbers can keep someone awake. Use the dimmer on the clock if it has one, turn the clock to the wall, or get a new clock.\nSome people have trouble sleeping because their biological clocks are waking them at weird times. To \"reset\" Dad's biological clock, have them get up in the morning at the time they are like to awaken each day and spend about ten minutes facing the sun.\nIf your mother grinds their teeth at night -- a common condition called bruxism -- talk to the dentist. Mom might need a mouth guard.\nKeep familiar, favorite photos at the bedside to calm Mom in case they wakeÂ up confused about where they are. If they travelÂ or have to spend some time in the hospital, keep these same items at their bedside there for continuity.\nÂ\nNowhere is the saying, \"use it or lose it,\" more meaningful than among older adults. Aside from its cardiovascular benefits, exercise combats depression and osteoporosis, reduces the risk of falling, cuts down on healing time when there are injuries and illnesses, and generally improves lifestyle. Encourage your grandmother to stick to a routine.\nAsk your older relative to keep an exercise log and consult it often. Compliment their progress and celebrate breakthroughs.\nYoga is a great form of gentle exercise that improves the immune system and promotes well-being, among many other benefits. Weight training, tai chi, swimming, and low-impact aerobics are also generally beneficial to seniors.\nMake your own exercise video for your mother. They might hate the idea of staring at a nubile twenty-something while they doÂ their stretching exercises, but what if, instead, they had an image of you or their granddaughter guiding them through the routine? If you own a video camera, don't pass up this opportunity to make each day more special for them.\nSet up an area of your Dad's home where they can exercise safely. Make it special: get an attractive exercise mat and maybe even hang up an inspirational poster. Get them colorful workout wear or a funny T-shirt (\"Over the hill? What hill?\").\nIf you can't go yourself, hire a reliable teen to take your parent for a walk. The outing might be less awkward if you give it a purpose, like a daily trip to the store for bagels and a newspaper.\nGardening, housecleaning, and shopping can be considered exercise. Redefine the word exercise as needed.\nThings change. From time to time, review your loved one's exercise routine to make sure it's still appropriate.\nEncourage deep breathing. Most people forget to breathe when they exercise.\nCheck with a doctor or physical therapist before your loved one embarks on any exercise routine.\n\"I've heard that advice about a million times and was assured by our family doctor that Dad's calisthenics were just fine for him. But it never occurred to me to check back after he developed a minor ear infection that left him with a slight balancing problem. It turned out that even some of the neck rolls he was doing were affecting his ability to stand up without getting dizzy.\"\nIf your grandfather isn't motivated to exercise, take themÂ to a ball game to remind them of what it was like to have the wind blow through their hair (when they had hair). Walking to your seats is enough to get the body moving, and the fresh air will do wonders for them.\nBring your older parent to a physical therapist for advice and general guidance. If you can get Dad's doctor to recommend the visit, insurance will pay for it. If not, it'll be a worthy expense, given the possible benefits.\nAll exercise routines, even walking, should start and end with a period of stretching. A stretch needs to be held for at least five seconds to be effective.\nIf your father refuses to exercise, try to get them to at least work on one of the important muscle groups: arms, legs, shoulders, or back.\nExercising to music is always more fun, especially if the music is your favorite. Make your loved one a special exercise tape of their favorite tunes. If your parent totally resists the idea of exercise, don't try to bully them into it.\nThe mall opens before the stores do, and in many areas, people have discovered that they're a great place to walk. Aisles are nice and wide, and it's temperature-controlled.It's also a great way to meet people. Make sure security has arrived on duty by the time your parent or grandparent gets there.\nExercise reduces stress. That's probably something you both need. Do it together.\nConsider a professional personal trainer. Even if it's too expensive to have one regularly, a couple sessions will get Mom started on the right track and allow them to develop an appropriate routine.\nIt's a good idea for someone else to be around when your parent exercises, just in case there are problems. If you or a family member can't be there, this is a potential job for a responsible teen.\nAn hour of brisk walking four times a week can drastically improve the quality of life for an older person -- or anyone else, for that matter.\nBuy Mom a pedometer so they can measure their distance when they walk.\nStart a senior exercise class in your dad's neighborhood. A small group can pool their resources and hire a teacher just for them, at their convenience. If no one has a basement big enough, ask restaurant owners whether their private rooms, which are rarely used during the daytime, can be made available. Or, perhaps the local school can let them use part of the gym when it's not being used.\nWalking is still the best exercise there is. Learn to enjoy walking slowly with your loved one.\nYoga classes can be beneficial to both you and your loved one. Consider taking classes together.\nIf your parent hates the idea of walking, ask them to help you by running certain errands for you (\"Dad, could you return this to the library for me?\").\nSwimming is often an option for older adults who have lost mobility. Also, water exercise classes are available at many swimming facilities.\nDancing: it's good exercise, it's a great social activity, the music can be therapeutic, and it's a wonderful way to meet people. Find out what classes are available locally, and don't ignore those classes that are aimed at kids. Instructors at those classes might be willing to start offering adult classes if enough students can be gathered.\nLook into special exercise programs for older adults in the neighborhood. Visit the classes on your own before you suggest your parent joins. There are some good ones out there, but some can be depressing to those who are fairly vital.\nSqueezing balls of clay is good exercise for arthritic hands, as are therapeutic squeeze balls made just for that purpose. They're available at most drugstores.\nOlder adults have found that weight lifting using relatively light weights strengthens the body, helps bone density, increases flexibility, and reassures them of their abilities.\nAlways check with a doctor before your loved one embarks on any exercise program.\nSOURCES: Family Caregiver Alliance (www.caregiver.org).

        "Feb. 21, 2024 â Mary Margaret Gorman is no stranger to the skin care trends of teenagers.Â\nAs the mother of two teenage daughters, she said she noticed face masks becoming popular birthday party favors and gifts among her daughtersâ friends a few years ago.Â\nHer daughters, now ages 13 and 16, had expensive skin care products on their Christmas lists this year.\nâThey each have probably three times the skin care products that I have,â said Gorman, who lives in New Orleans.Â\nLargely driven by viral videos on social media, elaborate skin care routines have become a craze among teenagers, and even older children. TikTok videos walk people through 12-step routines that often include applying products that are meant for adult skin. But experts warn that younger people in particular should be wary of facial treatment fads.\nDeirdre Hooper, MD, a dermatologist at Audubon Dermatology in New Orleans, said sheâs seen her preteen and teen patients, and her own daughter, adopt two main routines. One is the use of daily sunscreen, which she said, âis fantastic.âÂ\nâThe second trend is complex, multistep regimens that are being promoted by social media and not by board-certified dermatologists,â she said.Â\nAt worst, complex skin routines can cause more harm than good. At best, the products are usually a waste of money, Hooper said.Â\nHopperâs daughter received a gift card for a major beauty retailer for Christmas two years ago. The dermatologist let her preteen shop for what she wanted, and came home with multiple products that all did the same thing ââ mostly moisturize ââ despite having different names. Both Hooper and Gorman said the most appealing products among kids have fun names, like Drunk Elephant, or vague marketing terms such as âglow.â\nSome may see the routines simply as fun or a ritual that makes kids feel more grown up. But the obsession can cause real harm, according to Amina Ahmed, MD, a pediatrician at Stanford Childrenâs Health South Bascom Pediatrics in Los Gatos, CA.\nâIâm definitely seeing a lot more teens proactively wanting perfect skin,â she said. âThe expectation has really gone up as far as how flawless they should look at a younger age. There is a lot of pressure with social media to get the perfect picture.â\nAhmed has also noticed more teens are using more makeup, including for contouring and elaborate designs, âwhich can lead to other issues like dermatitis or irritation because of harsh products.â\nMore Harm Than Good\nMany products that are for adult skin are also too potent for younger people. Hooper said most teens should steer clear of thick moisturizers, and most retinol and hydroxy acids.\nProducts that contain hydroxy acids, including popular ingredients like glycolic or lactic acid, are chemical peels meant to strip older skin, but are too harsh to be used on adolescent skin. Hooper likens the products to the rough exfoliating face wash that was popular when she was a teenager, like the iconic St. Ives face scrub.\nMost retinol is also not medically necessary or appropriate for people younger than age 20, since these products are meant to build collagen to reduce wrinkles, not a problem most teens have. But if a young personÂ is struggling with acne or blackheads, Hooper recommends seeing a dermatologist who can find out if prescription retinol treatment could help clear the problem. The only over-the-counter retinol she recommends is adapalene, but with a caveat.Â\nâIt can be irritating, and if you donât know how to deal with that irritation, it can make things worse,â she said, emphasizing that families can save time and money ifÂ they go to a health provider first, rather than managing the condition on their own.\nWhile some products are too harsh for younger skin, others, including moisturizers meant for older skin, are too thick and can easily clog pores in adolescents who naturally produce more sebum as a result of hormonal changes, Ahmed said. Layering products can have the same effect.\nMany of Ahmedâs patients also have conditions such as perioral dermatitis, which appears as a red rash on the face and can be the result of a disrupted skin microbiome.Â\nâSometimes all these products upset the natural pH and microbe balance, which can make you more susceptible to things like dermatitis,â she said, noting that when people stop using too many products, dermatitis usually goes away.Â\nAntioxidants, such as vitamin C serums, can help protect the skin from pollution and sun damage, but just are not necessary for young skin, Hooper said.Â\nâIf you try an antioxidant and it doesnât irritate your skin, itâs OK with me as a morning routine. But the ones I know work are expensive, and I donât think I would recommend it to kids because they donât need them,â she said.\nWhich Skin Care Products Should Teens Use?\nBoth Ahmed and Hooper emphasize that, like most things related to health, skin care is not one-size-fits all. The skin is also an organ that changes throughout life, and will require different care.Â\nâA lot of patients think, if it works for my friend, it should work for me. But everyoneâs skin type is different; you may be using something that is causing more acne on your face,â Ahmed said.Â\nThere are some general guidelines teens should follow.Â\nâWhen you are young, you have such good natural protection and resilience to your skin, you donât need to buy a bunch of products,â Hooper said.Â\nAhmed said everyone should put on sunscreen in the morning and wear it throughout the day, especially if kids are playing sports outside. âMost sun damage happens when youâre young,â she said.\nAnd teens can use a gentle cleanser â but just one.Â\nTwelve-step routines âusually have multiple cleansers. They donât need to do all of that, they just need a mild cleanser to remove the excess sebum and dirt from their faces,â Ahmed said.Â\nHooper said if the skin is dry, kids and teens can wash their face only at night, and use a light moisturizer. If they are struggling with acne, Hooper said they should see a doctor.Â\nAhmed said parents should appreciate their kid taking an interest in their skin health and put a spin on a skin care routine being health-focused rather than beauty-focused.Â\nâItâs not a bad thing to take care of your skin,â she said.\nSOURCES:Â\nDeirdre Hooper, MD,Â dermatologist, Audubon Dermatology, New Orleans.Â\nMary Margaret Gorman, mother of two teenage girls.Â\nAmina Ahmed, MD, pediatrician, Stanford Childrenâs Health South Bascom Pediatrics, Los Gatos, CA.\n\n\n\nÂ© 2005 - 2024 WebMD LLC, anInternet Brandscompany.

        "Sept. 11, 2024 â The FDA has launched an investigation of the potential exposure to heavy metals when using tampons, the agency announced Tuesday.\nThe move follows the publication earlier this year of concerning laboratory test results that detected the presence of more than a dozen metals in a variety of popular non-organic and organic tampon products. That small study was a combined effort by researchers from Columbia University, Michigan State University, and the University of California, Berkeley.Â\nâWe want the public to know that before tampons can be legally sold in the U.S., they must meet FDA requirements for safety and effectiveness. Manufacturers must test the product and its component materials before, during, and after manufacturing,â the FDA wrote in theÂannouncementof its own upcoming study. âBefore a product is allowed onto the market, biocompatibility testing is undertaken by the manufacturing company, which is part of safety testing, and is reviewed by the FDA prior to market authorization.â\nThere will be two studies, the FDA said. One of the studies will involve laboratory tests to evaluate metals in tampons and potential exposure people may experience when using them. The other study will be a review of current research regarding the health effects of metals that may be found in tampons.\nThe earlier study, published in June by the journalÂEnvironment International,found levels of lead in every product the researchers tested and detectable levels of more than a dozen other metals like arsenic and cadmium.\nThe researchers tested 24 tampon products from a range of major brands as well as store brands. The tampons were purchased at stores and online between September 2022 and March 2023. Metal content tended to differ by whether or not a product was labeled as organic, the researchers reported. Lead concentrations were higher in non-organic tampons, and organic tampons had higher levels of arsenic.\nThere is no safe level of lead exposure, theÂU.S. Environmental Protection Agencysays, and the effects are cumulative throughout the course of life. The study authors noted that the average age that girls begin menstruation is 12 years old, and the onset of menopause occurs, on average, at age 51. One study mentioned by the researchers estimated that between 52% and 86% of people who menstruate use tampons.\nThe FDA plans a more expansive set of analyses than the earlier study, the agency announced.\nâWhile the study found metals in some tampons, the study did not test whether metals are released from tampons when used. It also did not test for metals being released, absorbed into the vaginal lining, and getting into the bloodstream during tampon use,â the FDA announcement stated. âThe FDAâs laboratory study will measure the amount of metals that come out of tampons under conditions that more closely mimic normal use.â\nThe absorbent materials in tampons, like cotton, rayon, and viscose, are potential sources of the metals. Cotton plants are particularly known to readily take up metals from the soil, although there are other ways that metals may enter the products, like during the manufacturing process.\nExposure to metals found in the initial analysis can affect a range of body systems and processes, including the brain, the kidneys, the heart, blood, and the reproductive and immune systems.\nThe vagina, the researchers noted, is highly permeable and substances absorbed there do not get filtered for toxins, such as by being metabolized or passing through the liver, before entering the bodyâs circulatory system.\nThe FDA announcement did not specify a time frame for the completion of its investigation.\nSOURCES:\nFDA: âBiocompatibility and Toxicology Program: Research on Medical Devices, Biocompatibility, and Toxicology.â\nEnvironment International: âTampons as a source of exposure to metal(loid)s.â\nEPA: âLearn About Lead.â\n\n\n\nÂ© 2005 - 2024 WebMD LLC, anInternet Brandscompany.

        "Some like it hot â¦ and some canât take the heat. Spicy food makes your blood vessels swell and even break, leading to purple marks on your face. If you have rosacea -- common in women after menopause -- the heat from spice can trigger a flare-up. It also raises your body temperature, so you sweat to cool back down. When sweat mixes with the bacteria on your skin, it can cause breakouts and blotches.\nYour skin is the largest organ in your body, and everything you eat affects it. Most margarines, especially the solid kind, have trans fats. They raise your âbadâ cholesterol, lower your âgoodâ kind, and create inflammation throughout your body. Inflammation is linked to heart disease and stroke, two conditions that can give you an aged appearance.\nThe more sodas and energy drinks you consume, the quicker the cells in your tissues age. In addition to the fizz, they have more calories and added sugar -- 7 to 10 teaspoons in 12 ounces -- than any other beverage. Combined with the bacteria in your mouth, that sugar also forms acid that wears down your tooth enamel and causes decay. Other cons include weight gain and a higher risk of stroke and dementia.\nOne frozen dinner can pack in half the sodium of a healthy daily diet. When you have too much salt, it causes you to drink more than normal and flood your kidneys. Any extra water will move to places in your body that have less salt, like your face and hands. Thatâs what makes you look puffy.\nThose margaritas donât look as good on your skin as they did in the glass. If youâve ever had cotton mouth in the morning after a night of drinks, you know alcohol dehydrates you. This makes a big impact on your skin, which is 63% water. Even if you drink a big glass of water, it will hydrate all your other organs before your skin. When you donât get enough, your skin looks and feels dry, and canât defend itself against wrinkles.\nPut down the pepperoni: Processed meats, like bacon, sausage, ham, and deli cuts, are smoked, cured, or salted so theyâll last longer without going bad. Itâs what makes them both delicious and dangerous. The sodium and chemical preservatives cause inflammation that can wear your body down inside and out. A little inflammation is good: It helps your cells heal. Too much can cause heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.\nThe difference between dough and a doughnut is a nice long bath in boiling oil. That bath promotes free radicals, or unstable molecules that damage other molecules in your cells and add years to your skin.You can also find free radicals in other fried foods like french fries, hush puppies, and mozzarella sticks.\nJust because theyâre not fried doesnât mean they look good on you. Baked goods like cookies and cakes are high in artery-clogging fat that put on the pounds. They also donât skimp on sugar, which in excess can cause diabetes, high blood pressure, and tooth decay (among other things). Inflammation is another reason to skip that sundae. The more inflammation you have, the higher your chances of arthritis, depression, Alzheimerâs, and some cancers.\nHow this for an acronym? Frying or grilling meat at high temps creates advanced glycation end products, or AGEs. Low levels of AGEs are fine (your own body produces them), but high amounts from charred meats cause inflammation that âinflammagesâ your body and triggers heart disease and diabetes.\nTable sugarâs chemical cousin, high-fructose corn syrup, sweetens sodas and fruit drinks. Among many other health drawbacks, it interferes with your bodyâs ability to use copper, which helps you form the collagen and elastin that keeps your skin healthy. Itâs also full of calories and puts you at risk for diabetes and heart disease.\nCaffeine is a diuretic: It stimulates your brain and your need to urinate. This can cause dehydration. When you donât have enough water, your skin stops releasing toxins. The backup makes you more prone to dry skin, psoriasis, and wrinkles.\nThough itâs better for your body than artificial sweeteners, agave is 90% fructose, a type of sugar that can be broken down only in your liver. When your liver is overworked, it turns fructose to fat and makes more free radicals, the compounds that damage your cells.Â\nIMAGES PROVIDED BY:\n1) AlexPro9500 / Getty Images\n2) JoLin / Getty Images\n3) Grafner / Getty Images\n4) NRedmond / Getty Images\n5) Fudio / Getty Images\n6) LauriPatterson / Getty Images\n7) LauriPatterson / Getty Images\n8) boblin / Getty Images\n9) LauriPatterson / Getty Images\n10) PRImageFactory / Getty Images\n11) grafvision / Getty Images\n12) aerogondo / Getty Images\nÂ\nSOURCES:\nAmerican Skin Association: âHealthy Skin.â\nMayo Clinic: âWhich Spread Is Better for My Heart, Butter or Margarine?â âTrans Fat Is Double Trouble for Your Heart,â âWhat is high fructose corn syrup?

        "Hearing aids are small devices that go in or behind your ear. These electronic gadgets make certain sounds louder so that you can hear better if you have hearing loss.\nHearing loss can have a big impact on your life, from your work to your relationships and emotional well-being. Hearing aids can make a big difference, especially if you pick the right ones and get help adjusting to them.\nHearing aid vs. cochlear implant\nA cochlear implant is also an electronic device. Part of it sits behind your ear. But it also has a part implanted under your skin. A hearing aid works by making sounds louder so that your ear can pick them up. Cochlear implants skip past the damaged part of your ear and work directly on your auditory nerves. The process of hearing with a cochlear implant is different.\nHearing aids may help you hear better when it's quiet and when it's noisy. Here are the basic parts and how they work:\nA microphone.This picks up sound around you.Â\nAn amplifier.This makes the sound louder.Â\nA receiver.This sends the sounds into your ear.\nHearing aids can help with hearing loss caused by age, trauma to your ear, medication, viral illness, or other issues.(Photo Credit: Moment/Getty Images)\nNot everyone withhearing losscan benefit from hearing aids. But only 1 in 5 people who could have improvement wear them. Most of the time, they're for people who have damage to their inner ear or the nerve that links the ear with the brain. These are some of the things that can cause damage:Â\nHearing loss caused by problems with the ear canal, eardrum, or middle ear is called conductive hearing loss. Usually, surgery or other medical help can make it better. But those options aren't right for everyone. Some people are born without an external ear or ear canal, which means they can't use a typical hearing aid.Â\nDo hearing aids help tinnitus?\nTinnitus is the medical name for ringing in your ears. Most people who get it also have underlying hearing loss. Hearing aids can help with tinnitus in a few ways:Â\nMasking.By making other sounds louder, they mask or cover the noise oftinnitus.\nStimulation.When noise outside your head is louder, your brain gets more auditory stimulation.Â\nCommunication.When you can understand others more easily and participate in conversations, you may find your tinnitus less frustrating and socially isolating.Â\nIf you think you might need hearing aids, there are several things to consider.Â\nBefore you buy hearing aids\nSee your doctor. Your regular doctor can make sure you don't have an infection orearwaxbuildup causing your hearing loss.Â\nGet a hearing test.If your doctor says your hearing loss is permanent rather than temporary, the next step is to get a test. You'll need to see an audiologist for that. If you don't know one, ask your doctor for a recommendation.\nTry before you buy.Ask whether you can have a trial period with your hearing aid.Â\nThink ahead.You might need a device that can adjust as your hearing gets worse over the next few years. Ask about increased capacity.Â\nCheck the warranty.Make sure you know what's covered and what isn't.\nUnderstand their limits.Get information on what hearing aids can--and can't--do, so that you're not fooled by misleading claims.Â\nBudget.The cost of hearing aids varies, and there are add-ons that can increase the price. Make sure you know what you're getting, and learn about options you might have to offset the cost. Â\nPrescription hearing aids\nYou'll need to see a health care provider to get prescription hearing aids.Â\nIf you have asymmetric hearing loss--meaning the condition is worse in one ear--or any other concerning finding, then you'll see an ear, nose, and throat doctor (ENT). You can also start with anENT, but that isn't typical.\nIf you don't already know an ENT, ask your regular doctor to send you to one.Â\nIf you have hearing loss in both ears, it's probably best to wear two hearing aids.\nOver-the-counter hearing aids\nIf you're 18 or older, you can buy hearing aids in a store or online without seeing an audiologist or an ENT. Over-the-counter, or OTC, hearing aids are meant to help people whose hearing loss is mild to moderate. They may be the right choice if your hearing trouble is limited to certain situations.\nAlthough you don't have to see a medical professional to get OTC devices, you may not be able to measure your hearing loss on your own. Anaudiologistcan find out how much help you need and guide you through your choices.\nAnother option is to have your hearing tested by a professional and get a copy of your results. You can use that information to buy your hearing aids online or in a store.\nThe FDA regulates OTC hearing aids. There are two types. \"Self-fitting\" hearing aids are those you can program to your specific needs. You'll use an app or a website to make adjustments. If your device is not self-fitting, it will have a volume control and a few simple settings.\nPros and cons of over-the-counter hearing aids\nBeing able to buy hearing aids without a prescription is fairly new, so all the advantages and disadvantages aren't clear yet.Â\nAmong the pros:Â\nPrice.The least expensive OTC hearing aids cost hundreds of dollars. Prescription hearing aids can run four times as much.\nConvenience. You can buy your hearing aids and start using them the same day.\nAmong the cons:Â\nYou have to self-diagnose. You may not be the best judge of your hearing loss and how much help you need.\nResearch.You'll need to do a lot of homework to learn about the different types of OTC hearing aids, their features, warranties, and prices before you make a decision.\nHearing care professionals have expressed concerns. First, a medical problem that needs attention could be causing a hearing loss. Another worry among audiologists is that, given full control of their devices, users will turn up the volume too high, which candamage your hearing.\nIf you get prescription hearing aids, the cost will range between $1,000 and $4,000. That total price includes the devices, fitting, maintenance, and helping you deal with problems that come up. In some cases, your total price might include replacing your hearing aid batteries.Â\nOver-the-counter hearing aids are generally less expensive. Because they're meant for people with less-severe hearing loss, you don't need as much professional expertise to get things right. OTC hearing aids can cost as little as $99 and as much as $6,000. It all depends on the device and level of service you choose.Â\nWhy do they cost so much? Hearing aids are small but complex electronic devices that contain advanced hardware and software. Manufacturers have made large investments in improving the technology, and hearing aids now can be customized more for your needs.Â\nMost private insurance doesn't cover the cost of hearing aids for adults, though you might have coverage for hearing tests and other evaluations. Check with your insurer. Medicare doesn't cover the cost of hearing aids or tests, nor do most Medicare supplement plans. Medicare Part B offers some coverage of hearing tests if your doctor ordered them. If you have Medicare Advantage, you may have some coverage for tests and hearing aids. For information about Medicare, you can call 1-800-633-4227.\nIf you're an adult with Medicaid, your coverage depends on your state's program. For more information, go toMedicaid.gov.\nPrivate insurance may cover more hearing services for children. For those who are eligible, up to age 21, Medicaid covers tests and treatment of hearing loss, which can include hearing aids. Your child also might be covered under your state's program.Â\nÂ How to lower hearing aids cost\nIf you're a veteran of the U.S. armed forces, you may be eligible for free hearing tests, hearing aids, and replacement batteries.\nWarehouse shopping clubs sell hearing aids. If you have a membership, check the prices there to see if they're lower than other outlets.Â\nSome companies run promotions around the holidays. You may be able to find a deal if you watch for sales. If you find the brand you like on sale at one store, you may be able to get another store to match that price. And some stores offer payment plans.\nSome nonprofit organizations help with hearing aids cost. Your audiologist may know of programs. The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders has aninformation clearinghousethat can answer questions about financial assistance. The Hearing Industries Association has anonline guideto finding financial assistance.\nÂ\nThe right device for you depends on:\nThere are two main types of hearing aids:\nAnalog hearing aids\nThese devices convert sound waves into electrical signals and then make them louder. They amplify all sounds the same way, though some may have settings you can store and switch between (quiet environments and loud environments, for instance). They're usually less expensive and have simple volume controls.They're not very common.Â\nDigital hearing aids\nThis type converts sound waves into numerical codes similar to computer codes, then amplifies them. The code includes information about the direction of a sound and its pitch or volume. That makes it easier to adjust the sound to what you need, whether youâre in a restaurant, a quiet room, or a stadium. Most will adjust automatically. Although this type costs more than an analog hearing aid, the results are much better. Theyâre also smaller and more powerful.\nThere also are different styles of hearing aids. They differ in size, placement in or on the ear, and how well they make sound louder:\nIn-the-canal hearing aids\nThese hearing aids fit inside your ear and are hard to see. An in-the-canal (ITC) hearing aid fits your specific ear canal and can help with mild to moderatelysevere hearing loss. But because of their size, they can be harder to adjust and remove. This style isn't ideal for children or adults who might have problems with very small devices. They're also prone to getting clogged by earwax. An invisible-in-canal (IIC) aid is nearly impossible for others to see. You may put it in every day, or it may be a device you wear for several months at a time.\nCompletely-in-the-canal hearing aids (CIC) and Mini CIC\nCIC and mini CIC are molded to fit inside your ear canal. These are the very smallest and least noticeable types. They're designed for those with mild to moderate hearing loss. They're less likely than some other types to pick up wind noise when you're outside. They may lack some features, such as volume control, that other devices have. The batteries are very small and can be hard to handle, and they also have a shorter life and need replacing more often. Like in-the-canal hearing aids, these can get plugged by earwax.\nIn-the-ear (ITE) hearing aids\nThesehearing aids fit completely inside your outer ear. They have a hard plastic case that holds the electronics. They're best for people with mild to severe hearing loss, but they don't work as well for children whose ears are still growing. They're larger and more visible than in-the-canal types, but they also have more controls than smaller devices. The hearing aid itself and its batteries may be easier to handle because they're larger. They may pick up more wind noise than smaller devices when you're outside. They also are prone to clogging with earwax.\nBehind-the-ear (BTE) hearing aids\nThese hearing aids sit in a hard plastic case behind your ear. A plastic ear mold fits inside the outer ear and directs sound to the ear. They're typically the largest and most visible hearing aids, though new, smaller ones are coming on the market. A different type, called a Mini BTE, fits entirely behind your ear, with a narrow tube that goes into your ear canal. This helps keep earwax from building up and makes sure your own voice sounds clear. Behind-the-ear hearing aids work for almost any type of hearing loss. These have directional microphones and can give you greater sound amplification. They also may come with rechargeable batteries. You may hear more wind noise than you would with other styles.\nReceiver-in-canal (RIC) and receiver-in-the-ear (RITE) hearing aids\nThese styles both have a behind-the-ear component that connects to a receiver in the ear or ear canal with a tiny wire. They're smaller than other behind-the-ear hearing aids. They allow low-frequency sounds to enter the ear naturally and high-frequency sounds to be amplified through the hearing aid. RIC and RITE may be a good choice for people with mild to profound hearing loss. They may come with more control options and usually have directional microphones. The batteries might be rechargeable. You'll have to watch for earwax clogging the speaker.\nOpen fit hearing aids\nThis type is similar to BTE, RIC, and RITE. It has an open dome in your ear, which keeps the ear canal clear. You'll hear low-frequency sounds naturally, through your ear, and high-frequency sounds will be amplified. It might make sense if your hearing loss is mostly at the high frequencies. It can make your own voice sound better to you. But it's more visible than some other styles and can be hard to put in, because it's not as customized to fit you.\nBone conduction hearing aids\nImplantable hearing aids work differently than regular hearing aids. One type is anchored to the bone behind your ear, and it's called a bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA). This device is surgically attached to the bone behind your ear and sends sound vibrations straight to your inner ear via your skull. BAHA might be the right choice if you have a middle ear problem or hearing loss only in one hear. But because surgery is required, you'll have to weigh the pros and cons.\nMiddle ear implant\nThis device is also called an MEI. It's attached to a bone in your middle ear, and it moves those bones directly in response to sound. It can help people who have sensorineural hearing loss, which is caused by damage to your inner ear.\nWaterproof hearing aids\nElectronic devices are rated for how well their design keeps out elements that might damage them, like dust and water. This is called Ingress Protection, and the number is the IP rating. The first number represents how well it keeps out solids, like dust. The second number represents how well it keeps out liquids. You can ask an audiologist about IP ratings or find them in the device's manual. The best score on the first measure is 6, which means total protection. Most hearing aids are rated 8 on the second score, which makes them water-resistant but not waterproof. That means it can survive being submerged in water, but only briefly. A company called Phonak says its AudÃ©o Life hearing aids have protection that \"goes beyond IP68.\" These are sometimes referred to as \"waterproof,\" but the hearing aid's rating is still IP68, and the company qualifies its use of the term waterproof.\nBluetooth hearing aids\nIf your hearing aids are Bluetooth-enabled, you'll be able to manage the control from an app on your smartphone or tablet. You also can stream audio from smart devices--including TVs--straight to your hearing aids.\nHearing aid features\nBe sure to ask if the device you choose has special features you want. Not all hearing aids have the same ones.Â\nDirectional microphones.These help you respond better to sound coming from a specific direction and tune out background noise.Â\nA direct audio input.This allows you to plug in a remote microphone or FM listening system. You can also connect directly to a TV or other device.\nNoise reduction. Most hearing aids offer some level of noise reduction, which filters out background sounds.Â\nRechargeable batteries.Maintenance is easier if you can recharge your hearing aid batteries instead of replacing them regularly.Â\nTelecoils.This is a type of technology that works with certain telephones and the sound systems in some public places like churches and theaters. If your hearing aid has telecoils, you'll be able to hear better on the phone and when you visit places that are equipped with compatible sound systems.\nVariable programming.If your hearing aids have this feature, you can create certain settings for different environments, for instance, one for conversation at home and another for a place with a lot of background noise. Then you can choose the setting that works best in a particular situation.Â\nRemote controls.This lets you adjust your hearing aid using a remote or an app on your phone instead of having to fiddle with the hearing aid itself.Â\nSynchronization.If you use two hearing aids, you can adjust both at the same time -- for instance, the volume -- if they are synchronized.\nÂ\nÂ\nÂ\nYour hearing aid can't make your hearing what it used to be. But as you use it, you'll become more aware of sounds and where they are coming from.\nWhen you first get your hearing aids, be patient. It may take some time to get used to them. In most states, you're allowed a trial period after you buy a device. Then, if yours don't work out for you, you may get a partial refund and be able try a different type that works better for you. Also ask about warranty coverage.\nIt may help to start wearing your hearing aids in quiet areas and to keep a diary about how you feel. Wear them around family members or close friends at first and ask for their support as you adjust. Some areas may have support groups for people who are just starting to use hearing aids.\nTest them out in different situations to see how they perform--indoors, outdoors, quiet places, louder environments.Â\nIf you have questions or concerns, go for a follow-up visit. Adjustments and help getting your hearing aids working for you may be included in the price you paid.\nTake time to learn how your hearing aids work and insist on a good fit. You want to avoid problems such as:\nHere are some solutions to possible problems:\nDiscomfort.It's not unusual to find your hearing aid uncomfortable at first. Your audiologist can give you tips on how long to wear it while you're adjusting.\nEcho. If your voice carries an echo or sounds too loud to you, that's not unusual. Your audiologist might be able to make adjustments that will help. Most people get used to this and it becomes less noticeable over time.\nFeedback.This may mean your hearing aid is clogged, doesn't fit right, or isn't working well. Your audiologist can help.Â\nBackground noise.Your audiologist may be able to make adjustments to reduce this.Â\nBuzzing.Sometimes cell phones and hearing aids have radio frequency interference, which causes a buzz.The best way to avoid this is to take your cell phone with you when shopping for hearing aids.Â\nYour hearing aids will last much longer if you take good care of them. Some tips to keep in mind:\nHearing aid batteries may last from several days to a couple of weeks. Battery life depends on the battery type, hearing aid power requirements, and how often you use it.\nIn general, hearing aids can last for 3 to 6 years. You may need a new one sooner if your hearing loss gets worse. Behind-the-ear hearing aids give you more flexibility because they can be programmed for a wider range of hearing loss.\nDigital hearing aids get stronger and better every few years as computer technology improves. This often prompts people to upgrade their devices.Â\nHearing aid cleaning kits\nYou can buy a kit that will help you keep your hearing aid clean. These usually come with:Â\nThe manufacturer of your hearing aids should provide instructions for keeping them clean. Follow those directions to make sure you don't void the warranty on your devices.\nIf you think you might need hearing aids, you're not alone. Experts estimate about 29 million adults in the U.S. would benefit from them. Hearing aids come in a variety of types and styles, and you can buy them over the counter now. Start with a visit to your doctor, and then an audiologist. They'll figure out the cause and degree of your hearing loss, and help you decide what hearing aids might be best for you.Â\nWhat are the best three hearing aids?\nSeveral factors go into choosing a hearing aid. Some are better for certain types of hearing loss than others. You might want to choose the least-visible model. Your budget may affect your choices. The \"best\" choice is different for every individual.Â\nWhat is the average cost of a good hearing aid?\nNow that you can buy hearing aids over the counter, many lower-priced models are available. Prescription hearing aids can cost as much as $4,000. Some well-rated OTC pairs cost as little as $100.Â\nÂ\nÂ\nSOURCES:\nAmerican Speech-Language Hearing Association: \"Hearing Aids,\" \"Sensorineural Hearing Loss.\"\nNational Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders: \"Hearing Aids,\" \"Cochlear Implants,\" \"Quick Statistics About Hearing, Balance, & Dizziness.\"\nHearing Health Foundation: \"Can Tinnitus Be Treated or Cured?\"\nAmerican Tinnitus Association: \"Hearing Aids/Masking Devices.\"\nMayo Clinic: \"Hearing Aids: How to buy the right one.\"Â\nAmerican Academy of Otolaryngology â Head and Neck Surgery: \"Fact Sheet: Buying a Hearing Aid.\"\nAudiology Online.\nHenryFord.com: \"Hearing Aid Styles.\"\nFDA: \"How to Get Hearing Aids.\"\nJohns Hopkins Medicine: \"Over-the-Counter Hearing Aids: Frequently Asked Questions.\"\nHarvard Health: \"Over-the-Counter Hearing Aids: What We Know So Far.\"\nWorld Health Organization: \"Deafness and Hearing Loss.\"\nBetterHearing.org: \"Hearing Aids.\"Â\nHearingResearch.org: \"Why Are Hearing Aids So Expensive?

        "Does it seem like you get sick more than you did when you were younger. When you are under the weather, does it take you longer to feel good again?\nImmunity -- your bodyâs defense system -- tends to get weaker with age.\nâJust as you probably canât run as fast as you used to in your 20s, your immune system doesnât work as well as it used to,â says Aaron E. Glatt, MD, chairman of the department of medicine at South Nassau Communities Hospitals.\nBut fear not -- at least not much.\nâCompared to many other bodily functions, most peopleâs immune systems actually do really great at any age,â Glatt says. Most of our immune systems work well enough that our risk for infection and illness isnât much higher than normal. Even better? No matter how old you are, thereâs a lot you can do to stay healthy.\nItâs a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs. Together, they defend your body against things that can cause infection, like bacteria.\nWhy does it ease a bit as you get older? Thatâs still a bit of a mystery.\nâThe medical community is still trying to determine exactly how and why immunity decreases with age,â says Kira Rubtsova, PhD. Rubtsova is an immunity researcher at National Jewish Health in Denver.\nWhat researchersdoknow is that most older adults:\nDonât respond as well to vaccines:Your immune system includes T cells, which attack other, illness-causing cells. Theyâre able to ârememberâ an invader, then defend against it better later. When youâre older, you make fewer T cells, and most vaccines require new ones to work.\nThe exception? The shingles vaccine. Thatâs one of the reasons it works so well for the senior set.\nAre more likely to get sick:Not only do you have fewer immune cells as you age, the ones you do have donât communicate with each other as well. That means they take longer to react to harmful germs.\nRecover from injuries, infection, and illness more slowly:âYour body produces fewer immune cells, including white blood cells,â Rubtsova says. âThat can slow down healing.â\nThereâs no set age when immunity decreases.\nâItâs like gray hair -- it happens for everyone at a different rate,â Rubtsova says. Thereâs no single test that can tell you that your immune system isnât functioning optimally. âThere are certain immune markers we can test for, but itâs not the same as being tested for, say, heart disease,â Glatt says.\nThatâs why itâs important to go to the doctor regularly, and get medical help if you get sick often or if youâre having trouble healing after an injury or illness.\nStay on top of your health.If you havediabetes,arthritis, or other things that affect how you feel and function, follow your doctorâs recommendations. âKeeping illnesses like diabetes well-controlled takes less of a toll on your immune system,â Glatt says.\nSleep well.âResearch clearly shows that too little sleep -- or poor-quality sleep -- lowers immunity, even in young healthy people,â says Gisele Wolf-Klein, MD. You should be getting at least 7 hours a night. If you snore or have trouble falling or staying asleep, see your doctor. You could have a sleep disorder.\nLook for ways to reduce stress.Over time,stressmay lessen your immune response. âWhen youâre constantly worried about something, it takes a toll on your body,â Wolf-Klein says. It can also trigger other issues, like poor sleep and a bad diet, which both may affect your immunity.\nSteer clear of sick people.âThe truth is, when youâre older, you have to be especially careful about germ exposure, because youâre more likely to become ill, too,â Wolf-Klein says. When you are around people who have contagious conditions, like a cold or the flu, try not to get too close, and wash your hands more often.\nDonât skip your vaccines.Even though they may not be as effective when youâre older, theyâre still an important way to lower your risk of many serious illnesses, including the flu and pneumonia. Check with your doctor to make sure youâre up to date on your vaccinations.\nMove more often.Moderate exercise helps keep you fit, which makes your immune system stronger. Research also suggests it helps cells move more freely, which helps them do their job better.\nEat well.Thereâs no one diet that improves immunity. But researchers do know that a varied diet full of vitamin- and mineral-rich foods (like fresh vegetables and fruit) helps your body -- including your immune system -- function at its best. Eating a healthy diet also helps you weigh what you should, which may put less stress on your body and improve immunity.\nDonât smoke.Smoking weakens your bodyâs immune response, making you more susceptible to illness and infection. Your doctor can help you figure out how you can quit.\nSOURCES:\nAaron E.

        "In the backs of our minds, most of us have at least a fuzzy idea of wanting a good death. But what does that mean to you and how can you plan for one?\nIt may not be easy to think about dying and what you want from it. You may have a lot of hard choices to make. But if you plan for end-of-life care, it can bring you peace of mind to know your wishes will be honored.\nIt also lowers stress on your loved ones. They wonât have to guess -- and maybe disagree -- over what they think you would have wanted.\nAn important question to ask yourself: How much treatment do you want at the end of your life? This deals mostly with life support measures such as CPR, feeding tubes, and breathing machines.\nDoctors use life support when some part of your body canât do what it normally does. It may ease pain or keep you alive until you start to heal. But in some cases, that same treatment may only lead to a slower death and a lower quality of life.\nIf you choose the option of refusing to have life saving measures performed (DoÂ Not Resuscitate or DNR), youâll still get medical care. Doctors will still manage your pain and give the other support that you need.\nCPR:Doctors use CPR (âcardiopulmonary resuscitationâ is the long name) if your heart or breathing stops. They may:\nCPR works best when youâre in mostly good health and someone starts it right away. But if youâre very sick, it might not work. You could also be injured from so much force on the chest.\nIf you donât want CPR and youâre in the hospital, your doctor needs to write a do-not-resuscitate order in your medical record. If youâre at home, some states allow doctors to write a ânon-hospital orderâ so emergency workers know they are not to give you CPR.\nFeeding tube:If you canât eat or drink on your own, doctors may want to use a feeding tube to give you nutrients. In some cases, a feeding tube can save your life. It gives your body food and liquids while you get better. Itâs also needed for some long-term illnesses.\nNear the end of life, a feeding tube may be less helpful. It doesnât cure or heal any illness. And it may even cause more problems than not eating at all.\nDoctors and families may disagree about this, so itâs important that your loved ones know your wishes.\nBreathing machine:A breathing machine called a ventilator pushes air into your lungs to help you breathe. You may need it in the short term until you can breathe on your own. In some cases, such as an injury to your spine, you might use it for much longer.\nWhen youâre at the end of your life, though, a breathing machine may do little more than draw out dying. As with other life-support treatments, it gives you more time, but itâs not a cure.\nWhile itâs important to think about what you want and make choices, you canât plan for every possibility. And you may not be well enough to make decisions for yourself. This is why you may want to name a health care agent.\nThis is someone you choose ahead of time to make health care decisions for you. This person can be almost anyone: family, friend, lawyer, or someone in your faith group. Youâll want to be very clear with them about your wishes.\nYou may also want to consider whether you want to donate your organs. No matter how you choose, itâs best to let your loved ones know so they can support your decision.\nIf youâd like to donate, you can put yourself on your stateâs organ donor registry. You can visit organdonor.gov to find out where to sign up.\nEnd-of-life choices can be hard to make. Not only do you have to think about your own death, but there are medical and legal decisions that arenât easy.\nOne way to make sense of what you really want is to talk about it. You can turn to your family and friends, doctors, or a lawyer. All can help in different ways.\nFamily and Friends:When you talk to your loved ones, getting started may be the hardest part. Here are a few ways to approach it:\nWhen and where to best discuss your wishes depends on you and your family. You may want to talk one-on-one or maybe with a small group. If you talk before you have an illness, it can help put you and your family at ease.\nDoctors:When you see your doctor, youâre naturally focused on taking care of your health so you can live as long, and as well, as possible. But itâs never too early to ask your doctor questions about end-of-life choices. In fact, it can be easier to think through when youâre not dealing with a serious illness.\nYour doctor can walk you through the pros and cons of the most common issues.\nLawyers:To make your wishes clear, you can use two different legal forms called âadvance directives.â The first is a living will, which tells doctors whatÂ kind of care you want to get at the end of your life. The second is called a health care power of attorney, which names your health care agent. (This is aÂ person or people who are able to speak for you if you lose capacity to speak for yourself. Also, it canÂ be canceled or changed at any time.)\nLaws about advance directives vary from state to state. If you split your time between states -- summers in one and winters in another, for instance -- then you do need to think about laws in both places.\nSometimes, families need to make decisions for a loved one without a living will. They may have no idea what the dying person wants; for instance, if someone was in an accident or other emergency.\nIf you need to make these choices for someone close to you, you might try to put yourself in their place. What was important to them? What do you think they would want? How did they live, and what can this tell you?\nAnother idea is to try and think of the personâs best interests. If you give the go-ahead for a treatment, will they be in pain? What will their quality of life be like?\nYou can also talk to your family. If you canât agree with each other, you may need to talk to a mediator. This is someone who helps people find common ground. You might also check with the hospital to see if they have someone who can help you decide as a group.\nNo matter how well people know you, your desires for how youâd like to die may not be clear. When you make choices ahead of time, put them in writing, and talk to your family, you can bring relief to yourself and the people who love you.\nSOURCES:\nNational Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, CaringInfo: âHow to Talk with Your Loved Ones,â âCommunicate Your End-of-Life Wishes.â\nCleveland Clinic: âUnderstanding Life Support Measures.â\nNational Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, CaringInfo: âEnd-of-Life Decisions.â\nNIH, National Institute on Aging: âUnderstanding Health Care Decisions,â âPlanning for End-of-Life Care Decisions.â\nMayo Clinic: âOrgan Donation: Donât Let These Myths Confuse You.â\n\n\n\nÂ© 2005 - 2024 WebMD LLC, anInternet Brandscompany.

        "Families, almost from their start, face forces that could pull them apart. When a family begins to mature, that potential loss of connection, that feeling of something changing, is difficult to confront.\nAnd it makes communication even more important.\nâThis idea of feeling connected becomes very reinforcing, to all of us, and it contributes to happiness, it contributes to mental health and it does contribute also to physical health,â says John Northman, a psychologist from Buffalo, NY.\nâItâs well known that when people feel better connected, that they feel better physically, theyâre certainly less likely to feel depressed â or if they do, theyâre in a better position to get out of being depressed.\nâOverall, it leads to a feeling of a greater degree of support and connection psychologically,â he said.\nThe research on the importance of communication in families is strong and varied.\nIn theHandbook of Family Communication, editor Anita Vangelisti, a professor at the University of Texas, writes, âCommunication is what creates families. When family members communicate, they do more than send messages to each other -- they enact their relationships.â\nA paper in the journalMilitary Medicinesays communication can cut both ways in families. It says that deployed soldiers can get a big dose of positivity when chatting with folks at home, but in some cases, that contact can have a negative impact.\nIt all boils down to this: Good family communication is important because families are what we most often turn to for support, Vangelisti says. If families arenât communicating, support systems can fall apart.\nHelp for family members can take many different forms, Vangelisti says, including:\nEmotional support: âMaking us feel better, sharing in happy moments together,â she says.\nEsteem support: âMaking us feel good about ourselves, validating when weâre doing well, helping out when weâre not doing as well.â\nNetwork support: âThat sense of belonging. Thatâs really important with families, so you kind of have a home base, a place where you feel accepted and you belong, no matter what.â\nInformational support: How to do things that maybe were done by others in another family setting.\nTangible support: Things like financial support and care packages from home.\nOnce you know itâs important for your family to communicate, you have to figure out how. Even now, when everyone has a cell phone handy, to keep the connection flowing can be tricky.\nHavenât heard from a relative in a while? Canât find the time to call back home? Emails are wonderful tools ... except when theyâre not.\nâEmails are notorious for generating misunderstanding, because of the speed and thoughtlessness with which people generate them,â says Arthur Bodin, a psychologist and former president of the American Psychological Association.\nThey can easily be misunderstood because tone is often absent.\nâIt makes for poor emotional communication,â Bodin says.\nLikewise, texts or tweets -- even phone calls -- can lack the cues you get only with visual connection. Anyone who has done Skype or FaceTime knows that those forms of communication arenât always the best way, either.\nStill, something is better than nothing, Vangelisti points out.\nâI guess what most communication people would emphasize,â she says, âis itâs not quite as much the channel as the way that channel is handled.â\nWith a kid away at school or a parent separated from the family, figuring out who makes the first communication move is sometimes difficult.\nâIf someone doesnât take that risk and reach out,â Vangelisti says, âitâs not going to happen.â\nSome psychologists warn about demanding communication.\nâCall me every Friday nightâ might not only be impossible, it might be counter-productive for someone trying to find footing in a new situation. Demands donât work in those situations, Bodin says. Understanding does.\nâFirst of all, you donât call them every night or on any regular schedule,â Bodin says, speaking specifically of a parent with a child away at college. âYou donât put a guilt trip on them if they donât want to call their mother or father.\nâYou recognize they have a life of their own. You donât try to micromanage them there.â\nStill, family members wanting a connection can find a way.\nEvery talk or letter doesnât have to be deep, either. You can talk about dogs, the weather, or your health, the neighbors that used to live next door, or your new ones. Talking about the latest crazy thing Aunt Edna said might actually help strengthen your connection.\nâA lot of the time people want these conversations to be deep, meaningful, impactful,â Vangelisti says. âAllowing them to be boring and routine, I just think thatâs another thing that we forget about.\nâAll those boring things, those are the things, really, that our relationships and our lives are made of. Letting those be part of our conversations at a distance lets us stay in touch in a real important way.â\nPsychologist David Olson devised something called the Circumplex Model of Marital & Family Systems to help examine and treat families.Â\nIt breaks down three aspects of marital and family systems:\nIt suggests these things are crucial to having successful family communication:\nPsychologists talk about âfamilies of orientation\" Â and âfamilies of procreation.\"Â Put another way, the family you were born into and the family you create.\nCommunication plays an important part in keeping them both intact because of the stress of transition.\nâTheir physical well-being is already going to be a little bit at risk under stress. Their body is in a stressful state,â Vangelisti says. âSo having that communication and that relationship can be really important. We just underestimate that.â\nThe good news is that families, even those in transition, have one huge advantage in the ability to stay connected.\nThey are family.\nâYou have a lot of history and you have those ties of family that have been there since [childhood],â Northman says. âDespite the -- should we say, âmishaps?â -- that occur along the way, in adolescence and into adulthood, you have those ties that maintain the connection. Thatâs where families can be particularly strong.â\nSOURCES:\nJohn Northman, PhD, psychologist, Buffalo, NY.\nVangelisti, A., ed.Handbook of Family Communication, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2004.\nGreene, T.Military Medicine, published online October 2010.\nMorningstar, M.Exceptional Children, January 1995.\nAnita Vangelisti, PhD, professor of communication, University of Texas, Austin\nArthur Bodin, PhD, psychologist; former president of the American Psychological Association, Palo Alto, CA.\nOlson, D.Journal of Family Therapy, 1999.\nWork and Family Researchers Network: âFamily of Orientation and Family of Procreation, Definition(s) of.â\n\n\n\nÂ© 2005 - 2024 WebMD LLC, anInternet Brandscompany.

        "Sept. 19, 2024 â Older and middle-aged people who followed the MIND diet for at least 1 year had less and slowercognitive decline, compared to people with significantly different diets. The benefits were especially pronounced in women and in Black people, according to results of a new study.Â\nOlder people who have cognitive decline have a harder time with thinking, memory, concentration, and other brain functions than what is expected due to aging.\nThe formal name for the MIND diet is theÂMediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet, and its goal is to support healthy brain aging. TheMIND dietencourages eating nine food types: whole grains, vegetables, green leafy vegetables specifically, nuts, beans, berries, poultry, fish, and olive oil. The diet also calls for limiting the intake of pastries, sweets, red meat, cheese, fried foods, and butter or margarine.\nâWith the number of people withdementiaincreasing with the aging population, itâs critical to find changes that we can make to delay or slow down the development of cognitive problems,â study author Russell P. Sawyer, MD, of the University of Cincinnati in Ohio, said in aÂstatement.\nFor this latest study, researchers used questionnaire responses from people who detailed what they ate for the past year. The data from the study came from a separate project that sought to understand geographic and racial differences in stroke risk. People in the study were ages 45 and older, with an average age of 64. They each took standard cognitive tests, including being asked to repeat three words back to an interviewer and to name the year, month, and day of the week.\nTheÂfindingswere published in the latest issue ofNeurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. The analysis showed that, overall, people who most closely followed the MIND diet had a reduced risk of cognitive decline. The researchers also found that women who most closely followed the diet had up to a 6% reduced risk of cognitive problems, but there was no corresponding decrease among men.\nThe team also evaluated whether the diet may impact how quickly cognitive function changed, and found that people who closely followed the MIND diet showed slower decline. The impact was the greatest among Black people who closely followed the diet.\nâThese findings warrant further study, especially to examine these varying impacts among men and women and Black and White people, but itâs exciting to consider that people could make some simple changes to their diet and potentially reduce or delay their risk of cognitive issues,â Sawyer said.\nSOURCES:\nNeurology:ÂâAssociation of Adherence to a MIND-Style Diet With the Risk of Cognitive Impairment and Decline in the REGARDS Cohort.â\nAmerican Academy of Neurology: âCan the MIND diet lower the risk of memory problems later in life?â\nHarvard T.H.

        "Oct. 17, 2024 -- Canât find time to exercise during the workweek? Scientists have good news for you. Â\nEvidence is piling up that condensing your exercise into just one or two days a week â being a âweekend warriorâ â is enough to reap the many benefits of physical activity. Â\nThe latest suchÂstudy,published inCirculation, shows a weekend warrior routine can ward off a long list of serious illnesses. The exercise pattern was linked with a lower risk of 264 diseases and appeared to be just as effective at reducing risk as more frequent exercise spread throughout the week.\nMost of the diseases studied affected the heart and blood vessels âatherosclerosis,heart attack, heart failure, diabetes,strokeâ but researchers found that the benefit extended to a surprising range of conditions.\nâIt was encouraging to see strong associations with chronic kidney disease,â said Shaan Khurshid, MD, MPH, lead author of the study and a cardiac electrophysiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital. âWe also saw the association with sleep apnea, and even things likegallstonesand heartburn. These all make sense but had not been previously shown to this level of detail.â\nThe âweekend warriorâ concept is nothing new. In fact, the termdatesback to the 1930s, referring to a military reservist who attends weekend meetings of their unit. By the 1980s, the name had expanded to include people who participate in strenuous activity part-time or only on weekends.Â\nBut today, the concept is drawing more scientific attention as the subject of a mounting body of impressive research that promises greater flexibility in how you choose to achieve your workouts.Â\nWhat the Research Shows\nIn the new study, researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital analyzed the data of 89,573 people from the UK Biobank, a group of relatively healthy middle-aged to older adults in the U.K. Participants wore accelerometers on their wrists that recorded their physical activity for one week.Â\nThe scientists looked at the data and classified people into three groups: regular exercisers who worked out several times a week; weekend warriors, who got at least half of their exercise in one or two days; and inactive people, those who got less than theÂU.S.-recommended 150 minutesof moderate activity a week.\nCompared to the inactive people, both the regular exercisers and weekend warriors had much lower risks of disease.\nTechnically, the regular exercisers had slightly better results â for example, 28% lower risk of high blood pressure compared to 23% for the weekend warriors, and 46% less risk for diabetes compared to 43%. But the differences werenât big enough to be scientifically meaningful, leading the researchers to conclude that total exercise is whatâs important for reducing disease risk, not how often you do it or how you split it up.\nAnother 2024ÂtrialinNature Agingfound that weekend warriors had a 26% lower risk ofdementia, 21% less risk of stroke, and a 45% reduction in the chance of developing Parkinsonâs disease than inactive people. Like the newer study, the data set was also massive at more than 75,000 people.\nAlso this year, the weekend warrior pattern was shown to beÂjust as effective as more frequent exercise forfatloss, helping people lose belly fat regardless of dietary changes.\nIn 2022, aÂstudyfollowing more than 350,000 Americans concluded there were no significant differences in mortality rates for weekend warriors versus regular exercisers.\nWhy Scientists Are Suddenly So Into Weekend Warrior Workouts\nTwo reasons, Khurshid said.\nFor one, advances in technology make it easier than ever to gather accurate information on peopleâs activity levels. âThey used to have people answer questionnaires,â said Khurshid, âand we know they tended to overestimate how active they are.âÂ\nBut itâs also a response to the rising popularity of weekend warrior workouts.Â\nâ[People] are working and have lifestyles that make it harder to exercise during the week,â said Khurshid. âThe incidence of cardiometabolic disease is increasing globally. Weâre trying to find optimal recommendations that we think the largest population can potentially adhere to in order to reduce the public health burden.âÂ\nU.S. physical activity guidelinesÂ haveÂpreviouslyrecommended more regular exercise and specific exercise lengths. Research from doctors like Khurshid is showing that exercise prescriptions need not be that rigid.Â\nâWe shouldnât put constraints on patients, telling them they need to do exercise âthis way,ââ said Khurshid, âbecause it may discourage them from actually achieving the right volume, which is whatâs most important.â\nSo, One or Two Days Is Enough? Well, Yes â but Thereâs a âButâ\nSpeaking of volume: Note that the weekend warriors in the new study didnât get all their activity in one to two days, just the bulk of it. And if you choose to get most of your exercise in such a small window, youâd better be willing to put the âwarriorâ in weekend warrior, working out for longer than you would in a typical exercise session.\nâIt did appear that many in the regular group did a greater amount of activity overall,â said study co-author Shinwan Kany, MD, acardiologistat Massachusetts General Hospital. The regular exercisers logged about 400 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity, on average, while the weekend warriors got slightly less than 300. âThis shows that if you work out every day, itâs easier for you to get your numbers up.âÂ\nThe study also had some notable limitations. The researchers didnât gather any information on peopleâs lifestyles, specifically what kind of exercise they were doing, or exactly how intense it was. They also tracked people for only one week. While Kany said that should be predictive of how they lived the other 51 weeks of the year, he allows that itâs possible some of the participants upped their game when they got their accelerometers and did more activity than they normally would, potentially skewing the results.\nThereâs also a question of safety. AÂ2014 studyfound that of participants who had a severe injury, 55% did so working out on weekends. Since weekend warriors like to get as much in when they can, itâs conceivable that they might push themselves harder and could get hurt as a result.Â\nHowever, Khurshid said his study didnât show an increased risk of musculoskeletal injury.\nOn the contrary, âthe literature supports that exercise is good for musculoskeletal conditions,â said Khurshid, âsuch as chronic back pain. Looking at a population of almost 90,000 people, the signal for the benefit is so much stronger that we didnât see a risk, but thatâs not to say injury isnât possible.âÂ\nThat risk may be greater for beginners or those with low fitness levels. âIf you didnât exercise for three months and decided to be a weekend warrior out of the blue, I would say thereâs a high risk of you injuring yourself,â Khurshid said.\nStill, the bottom line is this: Given all the research-backed benefits of exercise for many health conditions, what seems to matter most is getting it in consistently, in whatever way your schedule allows.Â\nâWhat I tell people is to get at least 150 minutes of exercise per week,â said Khurshid. âIf you can do more, thatâs a good thing, and it doesnât matter how you allocate it. Do it in a way that makes sense for you and allows you to be consistent over time.â\nHow to Get 150 Minutes of Exercise a Week\nWhile being a weekend warrior can keep you healthy, Robert Linkul, a certified strength and conditioning specialist and trainer in Sacramento, California, specializing in older adults, still recommends being active more often if you can.\nâIdeally, you should be a little bit active every day,â said Linkul, a member of the National Strength and Conditioning Associationâs board of directors. He suggests breaking the 150-minute goal down into sessions averaging what should be a pretty doable 20 minutes a day.\nIf youâre new to exercise, start by walking two or three days a week, and work up to rucking â walking with a weighted backpack or vest (5 pounds is plenty). Rucking gets the heart rate up higher while keeping the workout low-impact and offers a strength component as well that can prevent muscle loss. Three other days per week, you should perform strength training (a recommendation thatâs also part of the governmentâs physical activity guidelines but hasnât been analyzed in weekend warrior studies).Â\nBriefer, more frequent sessions help establish a pattern of exercise, making it easier to adopt as a part of your routine and lessening the chance youâll overdo it on the weekend.Â\nâThe body gets accustomed to doing action when you do it more frequently,â said Linkul. Going days without training could make you rusty the next time you are active, increasing the likelihood of an injury.\nIf you have trouble sticking with a routine, find a fitness class at your local gym or community center. âThereâs a camaraderie that develops when people train together that really helps people stay motivated,â said Linkul, who runs group workouts. âEvery week Iâll hear one of my clients say to the group at the end, âYou ladies are the best. I really didnât want to come today, but I knew youâd be here, so I made myself do it.â The older the person, the more they see their community shrink, and the more important that accountability becomes.â\nSOURCES:\nShaan Khurshid, MD, MPH, cardiac electrophysiologist, Massachusetts General Hospital.Â\nShinwan Kany, MD, cardiologist, Massachusetts General Hospital.\nRobert Linkul, CSCS*D, trainer specializing in older adults; member, National Strength and Conditioning Associationâs board of directors; Sacramento, California.\n\n\n\nÂ© 2005 - 2024 WebMD LLC, anInternet Brandscompany.

        "Caregiver burnoutÂ is a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion. It may go along with a change in attitude -- from positive and caring to negative and unconcerned. Burnout can happen when you donât get the help you need, or if you try to do more than youâre able -- either physically or financially. Caregivers who are \"burned out\" may haveÂ fatigue, stress,Â anxiety, andÂ depression. Many caregivers also feel guilty if they spend time on themselves rather than on their ill or elderly loved ones.\nThe symptoms ofÂ caregiver burnoutÂ are much like the symptoms ofÂ stress and depression. They may include:\nCall 911 or the NationalÂ Suicide PreventionÂ Lifeline at 800-273-8255 if you think you might hurt yourself or anyone else.\nÂ\nIf you are already experiencing stress and depression, get medical attention.

        "From the time you are born to around the time you turn 30, your muscles grow larger and stronger. But at some point in your 30s, you start to lose muscle mass and strength. You keep losing muscle as you age. If you lose so much strength and muscle mass that you struggle with basic daily activities, you may be diagnosed with age-relatedsarcopeniaor sarcopenia with aging.\nEveryone loses muscle with age, typically about 3%-5% each decade after age 30. Inactive people lose the most. The loss can become more noticeable and start to speed up at around age 60. After age 80, studies suggest somewhere between 11% and 50% of people have sarcopenia.\nOne reason that the estimates vary so much is that different definitions and ways of diagnosing sarcopenia are used by doctors and researchers around the world.\nÂ Sarcopenia can be a serious problem. Once you've lost a lot of muscle and strength, you may struggle to do things such as getting out of chairs, opening jars, or carrying groceries. You also can become frail and have a higher risk of falls, broken bones, disability, and death.\nIf you need a cane or walker to go even a few feet, that's a possible sign of sarcopenia, a loss of strength and muscle mass with age. (Photo Credit: DigitalVision/Getty Images)\nÂ While not everyone who lives longs enough will develop sarcopenia, the major cause of sarcopenia is aging.\nÂ Here are some of the things happening in our bodies as we age that might contribute to sarcopenia:\nThe reasons some people develop sarcopenia while others don't are complex, though age and inactivity are major risk factors. Here's a little more information about each risk factor.\nAge\nSarcopenia is rare before age 60, though the process of losing muscle begins decades before that. In addition to the biological changes that are part of the aging process, older adults are likely to have additional risk factors, such as inactivity, a poor diet, and chronic disease, which contribute to loss of muscle and strength.\nSedentary lifestyle\nStudies suggest that staying active as you age can cut your risk of sarcopenia significantly. The more time you spend sitting or lying down during the day, the more muscle mass and strength you are likely to lose. Spending a lot of time inactive may contribute to lost muscle and strength even if you exercise during other parts of the day.\nDiet\nA poor-quality diet appears to contribute to sarcopenia. Scientists are still sorting out the most important dietary factors, but low intake of protein is a suspected contributor because the body has increasing trouble turning protein into energy as we age. Some, but not all, studies show a link between eating too little protein and developing sarcopenia. Other dietary habits, including diets low in fruits and vegetables, may also play a role. Diets with a lot of ultra-processed foods â manufactured products with high levels of sugar, salt, additives, and unhealthy fats â also have been linked to low muscle mass.\nIn general, older adults who are malnourished, because they eat too little or eat a diet that doesn't provide adequate nutrients for their needs, are at higher risk for sarcopenia and decline more rapidly when they have it.\nObesity\nSome of the same factors that raise the risk for sarcopenia, such as inactivity and a poor diet, can lead to obesity. When you have both conditions, doctors call it sarcopenic obesity. Obesity appears to worsen sarcopenia. High levels of body fat increase inflammation and change how your body responds to a hormone called insulin, both of which can speed up muscle loss. Obesity can also make it harder to stay active, leading to a cycle of muscle loss and fat accumulation.\nChronic illness\nHaving achronic diseasesuch as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), kidney disease, diabetes, cancer, or HIV increases your risk of sarcopenia.\nThese are some of the most common symptoms of sarcopenia:\nWhat is the difference between sarcopenia and muscular atrophy?\nMuscular atrophy means loss of muscle mass. When you have age-related sarcopenia, you have muscular atrophy. But muscular atrophy isn't always sarcopenia because it can have causes other than aging. For example, someone on bed rest or with a very inactive lifestyle can lose muscle mass at any age. Muscle loss also can be caused by medical conditions that affect movement, such as a stroke, and by conditions that damage nerves needed for muscle function, such as spinal cord injuries and multiple sclerosis.\nTo diagnose sarcopenia, your doctor will start by giving you a physical exam and taking your medical history.\nYou may also fill out a questionnaire that screens for sarcopenia â giving your doctor a good idea of whether further testing for the condition makes sense. A widely used questionnaire is called the SARC-F. SARC-F stands for:\nSo, you'll be asked how much trouble you have:\nYou'll also be asked if you've fallen in the past year and, if so, how often.\nBased on your answers, you'll get a score of between 0 and 10, with 10 suggesting the highest chance that you have sarcopenia, and any score of 4 or more suggesting more follow-up is in order.\nFollow-up tests fall into two broad categories: those that look at how strong and mobile you are and those that measure your muscle mass.\nTests that look at your strength and your ability to move as you perform everyday activities include:\nHand grip test.In this test, you'll be asked to squeeze a device called a hand dynamometer, as hard as you can, one hand at a time. The device will show how much force you can apply with your hands, which is considered a good marker for how strong you are overall.\nChair stand test.You'll be asked to sit and stand from a chair as many times as you can, without using your arms, in 30 seconds. This is a test of your leg strength.\nWalking speed test.This test typically looks at how long it takes you to walk about 13 feet (4 meters) at your usual speed.\n400-meter walk test.In this longer walking test, you'll be asked to complete 20 laps of 20 meters each as quickly as possible, with no more than 2 minutes rest between each lap.\nTimed up and go test.This test times you as you rise from a chair, walk about 10 feet (3 meters) away, return, and then sit back down.\nShort physical performance battery.This combines three timed tests: standing from a chair, standing balance, and walking speed.\nA variety of imaging tests can be used to measure muscle mass and confirm sarcopenia. These can include:\nDual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA or DXA).This test, also commonly used to measure bone density, uses low-dose X-rays to measure your muscle and fat masses as well.\nBioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA).This widely available and inexpensive test can measure body composition, including muscle and fat, using a mild electrical current.\nMRI or CT scans.While these can produce highly accurate measurements of total body muscle mass, they are less widely used for confirming sarcopenia because of their limited availability and high cost.\nThe primary treatments for sarcopenia are lifestyle changes, especially increases in physical activity.\nSarcopenia exercise plan\nStrength training, which is also called resistance training, can help you regain strength and mobility. Your doctor may refer you to a physical therapist or suggest working with a trainer or taking a class to get started.\nA typical strength training program might include working with free weights or weight machines and stretchy resistance bands. It also might include so-called bodyweight exercises, such as push-ups, lunges, and leg raises. You should do a combination of exercises that work your arms, legs, abdominal muscles, back, and chest.Â\nYou might start with just one or two strength training sessions a week. The goal is to work up to higher weights and more repetitions as you get stronger.\nAs you work on strength, it's also a good idea to include aerobic exercise, such as walking, to build your endurance and improve overall health, and balance exercises, to reduce your risk of falling.\nMedications for sarcopenia\nNo medications are approved to treat sarcopenia. Some are under study but have shown no success in meaningfully improving physical functioning, even when they improve muscle mass or strength. They include:\nOther drugs that target factors that play a role in muscle loss, such as inflammation, are under study.\nSarcopenia can have a big effect on your quality of life, making it harder for you to do things you want to do and get around your home and community. Overall, people with sarcopenia are at higher risk for illness, injury, and death. However, the outlook varies from person to person based on age, other medical conditions, and any previous falls or broken bones.\nAlso, a lot can depend on how you respond to a sarcopenia diagnosis. If you start a strength-training program and make other lifestyle changes, you can regain some strength and mobility. If you do nothing, you'll get weaker and lose more muscle and may eventually need full-time care.\nIf you have sarcopenia, it's important to go to your regular medical appointments so that your doctor can keep track of your condition and suggest ways for you to stay as strong and healthy as possible.\nSarcopenia diet\nMany older adults with sarcopenia consume less protein and fewer calories than recommended. So adding calories, if needed, and adding foods with more nutrients, especially protein, may help. Experts around the world disagree on the right protein intake for older adults, but a common recommendation is to get 20-35 grams of protein at each meal. That's about the amount in 4 ounces of meat or fish, a cup of cottage cheese, or 1.5 cups of lentils.\nYou're likely to get the best results when you combine a protein-rich diet with strength training.\nIf you have other nutritional deficiencies, such as low vitamin D levels, additional dietary changes or supplements might make sense for you.\nYou can't prevent all the losses of muscle and strength that come with age. But you can slow them down with:\nÂ\nWe all lose muscle and strength as we age. But when you lose so much muscle and strength that you have trouble getting through daily routines, you may be diagnosed with sarcopenia. While sarcopenia can have serious consequences, you can regain some of your strength with exercise and a good diet.\nCan you reverse sarcopenia?\nYou can regain lost strength and even rebuild some muscle, though your age and other health conditions can affect your progress. The key is to start a strength-training program and keep it up. You'll see improvements in strength, followed by bigger muscles if you stick to an effective workout for several months. You won't have the body of a young adult, but strength training can, for example, give an 85-year-old the muscles and strength expected in a typical 65-year-old.\nCan a 70-year-old regain muscle mass?\nYes, you can regain some of your muscle mass at any age, with strength training and a diet that includes adequate protein.\nWhat is the difference between sarcopenia and dynapenia?\nDynapenia means a loss of strength due to aging and can be diagnosed with tests of muscle strength alone. Sarcopenia involves a loss of muscle tissue and is confirmed with tests that look at how much muscle mass you have. Under most current definitions, sarcopenia also includes loss of strength, so the two conditions can exist together and have a significant impact on your quality of life.\nSOURCES:\nAgeing Research Reviews:\"An Elusive Consensus Definition of Sarcopenia Impedes Research and Clinical Treatment: A Narrative Review.\"\nCleveland Clinic: \"Muscle Atrophy,\" \"Sarcopenia.\"\nClinical Interventions in Aging: \"Relationship Between Sarcopenia and Physical Activity in Older People: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.\"\nEndocrinology and Metabolism:\"Sarcopenia and Muscle Aging: A Brief Overview.\"\nFrontiers in Nutrition: \"Higher Ultra Processed Foods Intake is Associated With Low Muscle Mass in Young to Middle-Aged Adults: A Cross-Sectional NHANES Study.\"\nFrontiers in Physiology: \"Sarcopenia, Dynapenia, and The Impact of Advancing Age on Human Skeletal Muscle Size and Strength; A Quantitative Review.\"\nHenry Ford Health: \"How To Maintain Muscle Mass As You Age.\"\nInternational Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health:\"Protein Intake and Sarcopenia in Older Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,\" \"The Association Between Sedentary Behavior and Sarcopenia Among Adults Aged â¥65 Years in Low- and Middle-Income Countries.\"\nJohns Hopkins Medicine: \"Protein Content of Common Foods.\"\nJournal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle: \"Exercise for Sarcopenia in Older People: A Systematic Review and Network MetaâAnalysis,\" \"SARCâF: A Symptom Score to Predict Persons With Sarcopenia at Risk For Poor Functional Outcomes.\"\nMetabolism:\"Current and Investigational Medications For The Treatment of Sarcopenia,\" \"Diet For The Prevention and Management of Sarcopenia.\"\nNIH Toolbox: \"Grip Strength Test.\"\nNutrients:\"Efficacy of Nutritional Interventions as Stand-Alone or Synergistic Treatments with Exercise for the Management of Sarcopenia.\"\nNutrition: \"What is Dynapenia?\"\nObesity Facts: \"Definition and Diagnostic Criteria for Sarcopenic Obesity: ESPEN and EASO Consensus Statement.\"\nOffice on Women's Health: \"Sarcopenia.\"\nStanford Lifestyle Medicine: \"Stop The Clock: The Shocking Truth About Age-Related Muscle Loss and Steps to Fight Back.\"\nTufts University, Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging: \"Are You Losing Muscle?\" \"Nutrition, Exercise, Physiology & Sarcopenia (NEPS).\"\n\n\n\nÂ© 2005 - 2024 WebMD LLC, anInternet Brandscompany.

It could help ease your mind so you can sleep better.\nSleep disorders:Â Besides insomnia, these include apnea,Ârestless legs syndrome,Âperiodic limb movement disorder, and REM behavior disorder. Your doctor can see if you have one of these conditions.\nToo much downtime.Many people stay active well into their golden years. But if your days are too idle, you may find it harder to get good sleep.\nEveryone is different. If you sleep less than when you were younger but still feel rested and energetic during the day, it might be that you now need less sleep.\nBut if you have noticed that your lack of sleep affects you during the day, tell your doctor. There are steps you can take to get better rest. Many are simple tweaks to your daily routine, like setting a regular bedtime, being more active, and taking steps to ease your mind before you hit the hay.\nSOURCES:Â\nWolkove, N.Canadian Medical Association Journal, April 24, 2007.\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.Â\nThe National Sleep Foundation.\n\n\n\nÂ© 2005 - 2024 WebMD LLC, anInternet Brandscompany.

        "Hearing loss is the third most common condition in the U.S., after arthritis and heart disease. OneÂ cause is loud noise in the workplace, like machinery. About 22 million Americans face unsafe levels of noise at work. Things like motorcycles and power tools also can hurt your hearing over time. Try to avoid noisy activities or take breaks from them often. Wear earplugs or ear protectors that fit over your ears.\nA serious head injury can dislocate your middle-ear bones or damage nerves and cause permanent hearing loss. Sudden changes in pressure from flying or scuba diving couldÂ also harm your eardrum or middle or inner ear. Eardrums usually heal in a few weeks. But if your inner ear is badly injured, you may need surgery. Never stick cotton swabs or other objects into your ears. This can break your eardrum and cause permanent damage.\nHearing loss can be a side effect of some medicines, including certain antibiotics,cancermedications, and erectile dysfunction drugs. Your doctor will probably keep an eye on your hearing while you take them. But some hearing loss may be permanent. Other drugs that may cause temporary hearing loss include:\nCertain long-lasting diseases that aren't directly related to your ears can cause hearing loss. Some do it by interrupting blood flow to your inner ear or brain. These conditions include:\nAutoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, are also linked to some types of hearing loss.\nEar \"stroke\" (sudden sensorineural hearing loss) happens when you lose your hearing suddenly or over a few days. It most often affects just one ear. Injury, medications, or a medical condition might cause it. But in 90% of cases, doctors can't find any reason. If this happens to you, get medical help right away. Treatment can protect your hearing\nNoncancerous growths, including bone tumors, scar tissue, and cysts, can block your ear canal and cause hearing loss. Sometimes, removing the growth restores hearing. A rare tumor called acoustic neuroma grows on the hearing and balance nerves in your inner ear. Along with hearing loss, it can cause balance issues, facial numbness, and ringing in the ears. Treatment can sometimes save some hearing.\nFirecrackers, gunshots, and other explosions create powerful sound waves that may rupture your eardrum or damage your inner ear. This can cause sudden hearing loss, either temporary or permanent. In fact, hearing loss caused by gunfire or explosions is now the No. 1 U.S. combat disability. To guard your hearing, wear ear protection and stand as far as you can from the source of the noise.\nRinging in your ears after a concert? Thatâs called tinnitus. It's not the same as hearing loss, but they're related. The average decibel level at a rock show is 110, enough to do damage in less than 5 minutes.Â Any noise over 85 decibels can affect your hearing. Other risky sounds include leaf blowers and chain saws. Tinnitus can last for hours, weeks, or forever. To prevent it, wear earplugs and limit your exposure.\nCan others hear the music youâre playing through your earbuds or earphones? If so, you may want to turn down the volume. Using these devices can cause temporary or permanent hearing loss. The louder the music and the longer you listen, the greater your risks are. For safer listening, set the volume at no higher than 60% of the maximum. And don't listen for more than an hour at a time.\nEarwax protects your ear canal against dirt and bacteria. But it can build up, harden, and affect your hearing. This is the most common cause of treatable hearing loss. Think you have an earwax blockage?Â Don't try to remove it yourself. It's not safe to put a swab or anything else into your ear canal. A doctor can do it quickly and safely\nMany illnesses common in children and young adults can affect hearing. In ear infections, your middle ear may fill with fluid, causing temporary hearing loss. Other illnesses couldÂ damage the middle or inner ear and lead to permanent hearing loss. Diseases that can affect hearing include:\nVaccines can protect you or your child from many of them.\nSome children are born with hearing loss. This is called congenital hearing loss. It often runs in families. But it can also happen when the mother has diabetes, high blood pressure, or an infection when pregnant. Premature delivery, or trauma during birth, can also leave an infant with hearing loss. Jaundice also sometimes leads to hearing loss in newborns.\nHearing weakens as you grow older. Damage from noise and illnesses may contribute. But it can happen even if you protect your ears all your life. By age 75, nearly half of people have lost some hearing. But there are ways to help you function better, including hearing aids, cochlear implants, and therapy. Talk with an audiologist to see what might work for you.\nIMAGES PROVIDED BY:1) Photolibrary2) Getty3) Getty4) Getty5) Getty6) Photo Researchers Inc.7) Getty8) Getty9) Getty10) Photo Researchers Inc11) Getty12) Getty13) Getty\nSOURCES:American Speech-Language-Hearing Association: \"Causes of Hearing Loss in Adults,\" \"Causes of Hearing Loss in Children,\" \"Hearing Loss at Birth (Congenital Hearing Loss).\"ÂCDC: \"Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention,\" \"Preventing Noise-Induced Hearing Loss,\" \"What Noises Cause Hearing Loss?\"Merck Manual, Consumer Version: \"Sudden Deafness,\" \"Ear Tumors,\" \"Hearing Loss.\"National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders: \"Age-Related Hearing Loss,\" \"Potential Risk of Sudden Hearing Loss Prompts Label Changes for ED Drugs,\" \"Sudden Deafness,\" \"Vestibular Schwannoma (Acoustic Neuroma) and Neurofibromatosis.\" \"KidsHealth: \"Earbuds.\"UpToDate: \"Presbycusis.\"American Academy of Audiology: \"Myth vs. Fact: The Truth About Hearing Loss.\"Cedars-Sinai: \"Ear Barotrauma,\" \"Is It Really Dangerous to Clean My Ears With Cotton Swabs?\" ÂNorthern Virginia Resource Center for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Persons: \"Ototoxic Medications.\"HearingLink: \"Causes of Hearing Loss.\"Hear-it.org: \"High blood pressure can lead to hearing loss,\" \"A connection between tinnitus and hearing loss.\"Arthritis Foundation: \"Arthritis and Hearing Loss.\"Noise & Health: \"Hearing loss associated with US military combat deployment.\"Boys Town National Research Hospital: \"4th of July Hearing Tips.\"American Hearing Research Foundation: \"Common Ear and Hearing Issues.\"Brian Fligor, ScD, director, diagnostic audiology, Children's Hospital, Boston.Michael Rothschild, MD, director, pediatric otolaryngology, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York City.Â\nÂ© 2005 - 2024 WebMD LLC, anInternet Brandscompany.

        "This is the first in a two-part series exploring the psychological and evolutionary reasons for why small pains and annoyances can bother us so much.Part twois about âouchies,â small physical discomforts like hangnails, paper cuts, or mouth sores.\nOct. 8, 2024 -- If thereâs one thing that really drives Robin Kowalski nuts, itâs this: when her family members donât replace the toilet paper.\nKowalski, PhD, a professor of psychology at Clemson University, said the pet peeve isnât just some âreaction of hypersensitive disgust.â After all, TP is no big deal in the grand scheme of things, so why would something so minorfeelso major?\nOur pet peeves start small but can grow into something more, as is the case with any other negligible annoyance.Â\nYour list may sound like mine: I canât stand loud chewing; my wife hates it when my fingers fiddle with my feet while weâre watching TV. Or maybe you hate when someone smacks their gum, or says âlikeâ every other word, or watches videos on their phone in public places (enough!).Â\nThere is psychology and biology behind these triggers and reactions. But the underlying theme is rooted in anger and irritation.ÂÂ\nSome evidence suggests those emotions have been trending up. Though anger around the world declined slightly last year â dropping from 23% in 2022 to 22% in 2023, according to theGallup Global Emotions reportâ it remains higher than it was a decade ago.Social mediacan stoke anger and irritation, particularly during aheated presidential election campaign. In addition, a 2024surveyshowed that 75% of Americans feel extremely or very angry, often related to politics and issues in the news. And while thereâs a big difference between being angry about things that matter (world issues, relationship problems) and things that really donât (toilet paper, social media posts), your brain can navigate these emotions in a heathy or unhealthy way.\nAt the base level, these emotions arenât necessarily a problem, said Mark Zachary Rosenthal, PhD, director of the Duke Center for Misophonia and Emotion Regulation. Misophonia is a disorder that happens when you have a lower tolerance to specific sounds (see more below).\nOn the anger spectrum, rage is at one end, while irritation is at the other.\nâA main reason why humans have irritability or annoyance is because thereâs some thing or some person that is interfering or blocking them from achieving some kind of goal,â Rosenthal said.\nIf you feel road rage, someone is keeping you from getting where you want to go. Loud crunchers or phone-watchers or gum-smackers? Maybe theyâre preventing you from focusing on what youâre doing.\nAnother reason for anger, Rosenthal said, is that we sense a threat and our anger allows us to interpret the threat, communicate to others about the threat, and be motivated to take action and evade the threat.Â While the click-click-clicking of nail-biting doesnât put us in danger, our irritability is part of a larger context: Anger â all the flavors of it â is normal as a human emotion.\nâEverybody gets irritated and angry sometimes,â Rosenthal said, and thatâs because, evolutionarily, it includes a survival mechanism.\nThe Psychology of Pet Peeves\nOne theory: Pet peeves are likesocial allergens.\nâPeople who have allergies donât just wake up with them. Physical allergies start gradually, but over years, they develop a bigger response,â Kowalski said.\nVariables and context can make a minor annoyance feel intense and escalate your reaction. Whoâs doing the action? Whatâs your relationship to that person? Where is it happening?\nâCertain things may start triggering the anxious response,â Kowalski said. âOnce thatâs triggered, itâs really hard to dismiss it because itâs processing information in terms of that. Variables interfere with some of that. The sound of potato chips â if youâre taking a test, you canât just walk away.â\nHere are some psychological factors that can make minor annoyances feel disproportionately bothersome, said therapistÂIlene Cohen, PhD, author ofWhen Itâs Never About You.Â\nHigh stress levels.As stress increases, our capacity to tolerate disruption diminishes, so we become more susceptible to irritation.Â\nThe âaccumulation effectâmeans minor issues can pile up, creating a cumulative burden that feels overwhelming. âThis is exacerbated by cognitive biases, such as negative filtering, where our brains tend to focus more on negatives than positives,â Cohen said.\nControl issues,which refer to situations where we feel a lack of influence or power, are also significant. Minor irritations often highlight these situations, triggering frustration and anxiety.\nFamilies.ÂâWeâre born with a certain level and ability to handle stress, and if our family members or caregivers do not handle it well, we might also have a lower tolerance for it,â Cohen said.\nWhen Pet Peeves Are More Than Just That\nAboutÂ4.5% of Americanshave misophonia, according the latest research. Being angered by sounds can be considered a disorder if itâs so severe that a person is impaired by it â that is, if your everyday life changes because of it, Rosenthal said.Â\nSigns of impairment happen at work, school, or socially, and symptoms can be biological (heart beating faster), behavioral (what you say to the person who is doing the action that triggered you), cognitive (how you make sense of the situation), and emotional (how you feel).\nRosenthal said misophonia is similar to other disorders in which a behavior or reaction itself isnât a problem, but the extreme end of the spectrum is. Drinking alcohol isnât always problem, for instance, but the extreme end is substance abuse. Feeling sad isnât a problem, but the extreme end is clinical depression. Being annoyed at a neighbor mowing their lawn at 6:30 a.m. isnât a problem, but confronting them with your own weed whacker?Â Thatâs an example of how irritation morphs into behaviors and thoughts that have an effect on your life (or others). (A little-known condition calledÂintermittent explosive disordercan cause such angry outbursts.)\nâBased on available science, we do not have clear evidence that there is a single, specific pattern that occurs across all people all the time in all situations,â Rosenthal said. Why intense annoyance happens and how to treat it depends on the person and situation.\nWhat to Do\nAddress annoyances head on.ÂDeveloping problem-solving skills can help you cope with minor annoyances, Cohen said. That could range from politely asking someone to put earbuds in while theyâre watching a video loudly in public, or removing yourself from a situation temporarily if you know the annoyance will build over time. âBy breaking down problems into manageable parts and addressing them one at a time, you can alleviate the feeling of being overwhelmed by many small issues,â Cohen said.\nDeep breathing and heavy breathing.ÂMindfulness and deep breathing help manage overall stress, which makes it easier to handle minor annoyances, Cohen said. Other healthy activities can help, such as exercise, hobbies, and creative outlets that release tension.\nBe direct.ÂSometimes, itâs just a matter of being direct, i.e. âGosh, I know itâs my annoyance, but one of my pet peeves is when you leave a coffee-stain ring on the counter.â It can be a win-win: It might help change behavior while also helping you manage your emotion, thanks to the âcatharsis of expression,â Cohen said. âWe all have pet peeves and all complain to different degrees â I wish they would stop bothering me, so how can I practically get them to moderate their behavior?â Kowalski said.\nDetermine if your reaction is excessive.ÂCohen said thatÂcognitive behavioral therapycan help build resilience, which will help you handle minor annoyances. If you notice that minor annoyances bother you more than they should or that they create some kind of conflict beyond a reasonable reaction, like physical tension or ongoing relationship conflict, that can signal that something bigger is bothering you and may need to be addressed with professional or medical assistance.Â Check for certificates and licenses of therapists in your area.\nThink holistically.ÂWork with clinicians to identify patterns and interventions to change those patterns. While treatment for misophonia must be tailored to the individual, Rosenthal and his team developed aÂ16-week protocolthat involves cognitive behavioral therapy. AÂmultimodal approachis best, he said, perhaps seeing an audiologist, a mental health provider, an occupational therapist, or even a neurologist if you also have migraine, vertigo, or dizziness. âUse that as a way to get treatment plans that you can choose from that are reasonably based in the best available science,â Rosenthal said.\nSOURCES:\nRobin Kowalski, PhD, professor of psychology, Clemson University, Clemson, South Carolina.\nMark Zachary Rosenthal, PhD, director, Duke Center for Misophonia and Emotion Regulation, Durham, North Carolina.\nIlene Cohen, PhD, therapist; author;When Itâs Never About You.Â\n\n\n\nÂ© 2005 - 2024 WebMD LLC, anInternet Brandscompany.

        "Oct. 23, 2024 -- Some popular and eye-catching exercises, performed by very fit and flexible athletes, are making the rounds online.Â\nKnown as âcore compressionâ moves,Âthe exercisespop up often on social media: L-sits, V-sits, single-leg raises, and others that target your abdominal muscles and hip flexors. They involve bringing yourfeetcloser to your head to strengthen your core.Â\nBut theyâre not the best option for those of us who are (ahem) slightly less fit and flexible than fitness models, experts say.Â\nâWe frequently see examples on social media of questionableexercisepractices that develop into trends, and in my opinion, âcore compressionâ training is one of those,â said David Diggin, PhD, associate professor of exercise science at Ithaca College in Ithaca, New York.Â\nThese exercises can be beneficial for athletes, especially gymnasts âÂ and some of the posters appear to be gymnasts. And the goal is commendable: Strengthen your core to counteract the effects of our sedentary lifestyle.\nBut they donât help much with everyday activities and can exacerbate lower-back issues, Diggin said.\nThe Problem with #CoreCompression\nHereâs what happens if you sit for much of the day, Diggin said: You shorten your abdominal muscles and hip flexors and elongate some of yourback muscles. If you perform these core compression exercises, âweâre stretching those muscles at the back of our body more, and weâre strengthening the muscles at the front of our body more, which are already shortened.âÂ\nIdeally, your exercises will help you with real-world activities, like picking up laundry baskets or raking leaves, which tend to involve twisting and rotating. Core compression exercises focus on linear, straight-line motions.\nâEspecially with Instagram, we kind of see all of these click-baity type exercises,â said Lewis Lupowitz, DPT, a clinical specialist in sportsphysical therapyin Woodbury, NY. A post of someone doing a standard bodyweight squat is ânot engaging content,â Lupowitz said. But sensible, basic exercises like squats are important for building strength.\nAnother problem: The term âcore compressionâ can mean different things to different people. While on social media it tends to be things like leg lifts, to professionals it could also mean anything where the core is engaged. Or it could be like a loaded squat, where you have to use your body to stabilize thatweightthatâs on your back.Â\nâMany exercises like squats, deadlifts, bench press, you have to compress your core to stay stable,â said Shawn Arent, PhD, professor of exercise science at the University of South Carolina. âEverything just winds up with these new names.â\nSafe, Sensible Alternatives\nMany exercises should engage the core. âTo me, core training is squatting, hinging, carrying, pushing, pressing -- your standard movements,â Lupowitz said. He offers a simple tweak for additional core work: âIf we do it with maybe one weight in one arm thatâs heavier than the weight in the other arm âÂ versus always even keel âÂ youâre training core to stabilize, to balance.âÂ\nFor instance, a simpleÂdumbbell shoulder presscould be done with a heavier weight in your left hand and a lighter one in your right. Repeat the motion 10 times, then switch the weights and repeat. The unequal weights mean your core must engage to prevent you from twisting, Lupowitz said. This builds rotational strength â the ability of the core muscles to effectively twist and rotate the torso while stabilizing your back. No weight? Use a bottle of water or a can ofvegetables.\nDigginsâ favorite exercise for people with desk jobs is a plank âÂ keeping your body straight while holding yourself off the ground with your forearms and knees, or hands andtoeslike a pushup. These can be done with your tummy toward the ground (front plank) or your side toward the ground (side plank). Planks engage core muscles, including the transverse abdominis, internal obliques, and rectus abdominis.Â\nAnd by adding a bit of extra movement to your planks â by tapping alternate shoulders as you hold a front plank, or by moving from side plank to front plank to opposite side plank, you add rotational movement, Arent said.Â\nEven breathing more actively can help your core while youâre sitting. âTake a nice two-second inhale through thenoseand really feel yourself not expand upward, but expand more outward, and then as you exhale, pursed lips, you can create core compression that way,â said Lupowitz.\nWhat Deskbound Workers Can Do\nIf you sit for much of the day, itâs important to get your butt engaged from time to time, said Arent. While seated, your hip flexors are shortened and your rear-end muscles are stretched.Â\nAÂreverse plankcan help. Sit on the floor with your legs straight in front of you. Place your hands just behind you, fingers forward. Lift yourhipsoff the ground, forming a straight line from your head to your heels. This exercise elongates your body and strengthens your backside.\nArent also recommended lunges,Âsquats, split squats (a squat with one foot stepped in front of the other),Âglute bridges(lying on your back with your knees bent and lifting your pelvis into the air), and step-ups (stepping on and off a platform). All are simple, safe, and effective.\nEveryday activities can become exercises, Lupowitz said. âInstead of just rushing down the stairs, use the stairs as an exerciseâ by ascending or descending slowly and in control.\nStretching is also crucial. âIf youâre sitting a lot, also stretch those muscles that are getting so contracted,â Arent said. He recommends a cobra pose â lying on your stomach, placing your hands beneath your shoulders, and lifting your chest off the ground â to elongate the core and stretch whatâs been shortening while sitting.\nBut if youâre tempted to try an exercise you see on social media, go ahead, Arent said, as long as it doesnât become your everyday go-to exercise. As for core compression moves, âIf you were to do those once a week, itâs not the worst thing in the world.â But start with simple, safer alternatives.\nSOURCES:\nDavid Diggin, PhD, associate professor of exercise science, Ithaca College, Ithaca, New York.\nLewis Lupowitz, DPT, clinical specialist in sports physical therapy; Woodbury, New York.\nShawn Arent, PhD, professor of exercise science, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina.\n\n\n\nÂ© 2005 - 2024 WebMD LLC, anInternet Brandscompany.

        "With age, you can start to lose more of this mineral than you absorb. That can make your bones break more easily (osteoporosis), especially for women after menopause.Calciumhelps your muscles, nerves, cells, and blood vessels work right. You get most of it from your bones, which get it from food. Women over 50 and men over 70 should get about 20% more than other adults. Milk, yogurt, and cheese are good sources.\nIt helps make blood and nerve cells. You get it naturally from animal foods like meat, fish, eggs, and dairy. Pills, shots, and âB12-fortifiedâ foods, like breakfast cereal, are other sources. Most Americans eat enough, but age can change that. Up to 30% of people over 50 have atrophic gastritis, which makes it harder for your body to absorb it from foods. Antacids, some meds, and weight loss surgery can contribute to a lack ofB12.\nYour body needs it to absorb calcium. So take them in tandem to help prevent osteoporosis.Vitamin Dalso helps your muscles, nerves, and immune system work right. Most people get some vitamin D from sunlight. But your body is less able to convert sunâs rays to vitamin D as you age. Itâs harder to get this vitamin from foods, but fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines are a good source.\nYour body uses it to fight germs and to make energy. It also helps babiesâ brains grow. You need moreB6as you get older. Some studies have found links between high B6 blood levels in seniors and better memory. But the vitamin doesnât seem to improve mental abilities in people with dementia. Chickpeas are an easy and inexpensive source. So are liver, fatty fish and fortified breakfast cereals.\nIt helps your body make protein and bone, and it keeps your blood sugar stable. You can get it from nuts, seeds, and leafy greens. But older people tend to eat less of it. Plus, they're more likely to have long-term health conditions or take many medications, both of which may leave you short ofmagnesium.\nThese âfriendlyâ bacteria are good for your gut. You get them from fermented foods like yogurt or sauerkraut, or from supplements. They can help with digestive issues like diarrhea or irritable bowel syndrome, and may even protect against allergies.Probioticsare likely safe if youâre healthy. But talk to your doctor first if you have any medical issues or a weakened immune system.\nThese fatty acids are called âessentialâ because your body canât make them. Theyâre important for your eyes, brain, and sperm cells. They also could help protect against age-related disease like Alzheimerâs, arthritis, and macular degeneration, which can cause blindness. Unless your doctor says otherwise, itâs best to get youromega-3sfrom food like fatty fish, walnuts, canola oil, or flaxseed.\nMany American seniors donât get enough of this underappreciated micronutrient. It helps your sense of smell and taste, and fights infections and inflammation -- all important jobs in older bodies.Zincalso may protect your vision. Oysters are far and away the best source of this mineral. Otherwise, you can get it from beef, crab, and fortified breakfast cereals.\nIt protects your cells from damage and infection, and keeps your thyroid working the right way.Seleniumalso can keep your muscles strong, and may help prevent age-linked illnesses like dementia, some types of cancer, and thyroid disease. Just one or two Brazil nuts a day should be enough. Donât overdo it. Too much selenium can make your hair fall out and turn your nails brittle.\nPotassiumplays a part in almost everything inside your body, including your heart, kidneys, muscles, and nerves. It also may help protect against stroke, high blood pressure, and osteoporosis. Many Americans donât get enough. Dried apricots, bananas, spinach, milk, and yogurt are good sources. Ask your doctor before you take supplements. They can interfere with medications for high blood pressure, migraine, and other conditions.\nThis natural form of vitamin B9 is in leafy greens, nuts, beans, and other foods. Pregnant women take a lab-made form of vitamin B9 called folic acid to help prevent birth defects. Folate helps with cell growth and may protect against stroke and certain cancers. Most Americans get enough.Folatefound in foods is safe. But too much folic acid from supplements or fortified foods can raise your odds of having colon cancer or nerve damage.\nYou probably know fiber is good for you. But did you know itâs even more important as you age?Fiberhelps protect against strokes, helps you poop more regularly, and lowers your cholesterol and blood sugar -- big benefits in older bodies. Women over 50 should get at least 21 grams a day, while men need 30 grams, but most people donât get that much. Thatâs equal to about 6-8 servings of whole grains, or 8-10 servings of vegetables.\nWhether itâs vitamins, minerals, or fiber, itâs best to get them from foods instead of pills. But that can be a challenge for some older Americans, especially if you donât eat abalanced diet. Youâre most likely to lack vitamin D, potassium, calcium, or dietary fiber. If you think you need more than you can get from food, talk to your doctor about supplements that will be safe with your meds, diet, and health.\nThereâs little, if any, proof thatmultivitaminsbenefit seniors who are otherwise healthy. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against daily multivitamins to ward off cancer or heart disease. Multivitamins marketed at seniors may be tailored with higher doses of vitamins D or B12 or less iron. But unless you have a poor appetite or have conditions that keep you from eating a healthy diet, you probably donât need them.\nIMAGES PROVIDED BY:\n1) Kevin Mackintosh / Getty Images\n2) karandaev / Thinkstock\n3) Stockbyte / Thinkstock\n4) Jose Luis Pelaez Inc / Getty Images\n5) Tassii / Getty Images\n6) bhofack2 / Getty Images\n7) margouillatphotos / Thinkstock\n8) bonchan / Thinkstock\n9) SharafMaksumov / Thinkstock\n10) Jolkesky / Thinkstock\n11) YelenaYemchuk / Thinkstock\n12) Marrypopins / Thinkstock\n13) Science Photo Library / Getty Images\n14) MirageC / Getty Images\nÂ\nÂ\nSOURCES:\nAmerican Heart Association: â7 is the lucky number for reducing stroke risk.â\nMayo Clinic: âDietary fiber: Essential for a healthy diet.â\nNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health: âOmega-3 Supplements: In Depth,â âProbiotics: In Depth.â\nNational Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements: âMultivitamin/mineral Supplements,â âFolate,â âPotassium,â âSelenium,â âZinc,â âOmega-3 Fatty Acids,â âMagnesium,â âB6,â âVitamin D,â âB12,â âCalcium.â\nOregon State University: âZinc deficiency mechanism linked to aging, multiple diseases.â\nThe American Journal of Clinical Nutrition: âAssociation of low plasma selenium concentrations with poor muscle strength in older community-dwelling adults: the InCHIANTI Study.â\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force: âVitamin Supplementation to Prevent Cancer and CVD: Preventive Medication.â\nHarvard Medical School: âShould you take âseniorâ multivitamins?â\nÂ© 2005 - 2024 WebMD LLC, anInternet Brandscompany.

        "If your mother lives in Phoenix and you're in New York, how do you help take care of them? Angela Heath, director of the Eldercare Locator Hotline of the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging, has compiled 10 strategies to help you cope. This article is adapted from Heath's book,Long-Distance Caregiving: A Survival Guide for Far Away Caregivers.\nGet organizedKeep track of important information in a care log.\nIdentify your informal networkAsk for help from people in the older person's community, such as relatives, neighbors, longtime family friends, and members of religious, civic, and social organizations. Ask them to call youÂ if they spot a problem.\nInvestigate travel alternativesBe prepared to \"care commute.\" Investigate travel options in advance. Keep your car in good repair, and check on the route and weather before traveling.\nIf you rent a car, look for the best rates. Don't pay for insurance if you already carry full coverage or your credit card company offers coverage. You may get a discount when buying bus or train tickets if you disclose that it's an emergency. Purchase airline tickets seven days in advance and stay over a Saturday night.\nDiscuss legal and financial issuesThese topics may be difficult to talk about, but they help ensure that the older person maintains decision-making authority even when incapacitated. Preplanning will also lessen family disagreements and protect family resources.\nTake care of necessary paperworkFind all legal, financial, andinsurancedocuments, including birth certificates, social security cards, marriage or divorce decrees, wills, and power of attorney.

        "With aging comes wisdom, perspective, and yes, changes that may sap your energy. Even if youâre not dancing quite as fast as you once did, there are ways you can keep that bounce in your step.\nFocus on:\n\nIf youâve been eating the same things for a while, take a fresh look at whatâs on your plate. The right types of food can raise your energy and make you feel better.\nAs you age, your bodyâs ability to turn food into energy slows down. As a result, many put onweight. Still, you can help yourself stay fit and energetic.\nSugar levelsplay a big role. Some experts say âlow-glycemicâ foods, like beans, non-starchy veggies, nuts, and whole-grain products, can help keep yourblood sugarin balance.\nâHigh-glycemicâ foods, like white rice, whitebread, andsugar-sweetened drinks, can cause fast spikes in your blood sugar. You may feel a brief energy jolt, but when the dip comes, you may feel more drained than before.\nToo few calories can leave your body starved for energy. Too many can make yougain weight, which can make you feel sluggish.\nHow much you should eat each day depends on several things, especially how active you are. Talk to your doctor or a dietitian about how many calories you need.\nYou may notice youâreworking outless than you were when you were younger. Perhaps training for 5Ks has given way to after-dinner strolls.\nThe more active you are, the more energetic youâll feel. Exercise and physical activity are great ways to help your mood, too. If you have issues that stop you from doing the things you once enjoyed, feel free to get creative. Ifarthritisin your knees keeps you fromrunningor playing basketball,swimmingor cycling might work for you.\nYou shouldnât stop moving as you get older. Just move in a different way. Look for fitness programs at local senior centers or find a partner so you can motivate each other. If you have trouble finding time to be active, maybe a workout first thing in the morning, before you do anything else, can do the trick. Just make sure you eat somebreakfastfirst.\nTalk to your doctor before you begin a new routine.\nFor some of us, itâs one of lifeâs little jokes: When you retire and donât have to get up for work, you canât seem tosleepin anymore.\nBut getting enough shut-eye is important. Most people need about 7 hours a night. If youâre not getting that much, for whatever reason, look for ways to adjust your nighttime routine.\nTry not to drinkalcoholright before bedtime. While it might make you drowsy for a little while, it actually makes it harder to get a full nightâs sleep.\nYou should also:\nIf you still can't get enough sleep, talk with your doctor.\nFor a few more ways to improve energy and mood as you age, you might:\nCut back onalcoholin general.As you age, its effects stay with you longer.\nDrink morewater.If you're even a little dehydrated, it can sap your energy and affect your mood.\nCutstresswhere you can.For example, try to scale back your to-do list if you feel like you are spread too thin.

        "You get one body and you want to keep it moving and functioning. Getting older shouldn't mean you stop. One of the best ways to stay on the move is with preventive health care. Some screenings and tests can help your doctor find problems early, before they cause bigger problems.\nDonât let cost keep you from having these tests. Most health plans, including Medicare, pay for preventive tests. Your doctor can help make the case, if need be. They may also be able to send you to free or low-cost programs.\n1. Blood pressure check:High blood pressure can cause a heart attack, a stroke, eye problems and kidney problems without you even knowing your blood pressure is high. Thatâs why itâs important to get your blood pressure checked, even if you donât think you have a problem. If your blood pressure is lower than 120/80, at least once every year is usually fine. If itâs higher, your doctor probably will want to check it more often.\n2. Cholesterol screening:Heart disease is one of the top causes of death in the U.S. One of its main risk factors is high cholesterol. After you turn 20, you should start getting your cholesterol tested at least once every 4 to 6 years. A simple blood test shows your levels and risk for heart disease.\nAs you age, your risk for heart disease goes up. If youâre in your 50s, it's important to keep getting screened.\n3. Mammogram:Experts agree that this is the best way to find breast cancer early. There's some debate about how often you should get one.\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force says all women between ages 50 and 74 should have a mammogram every 2 years.Â The American Cancer Society says if youâre over 40, you should get one each year.Â Talk with your doctor to determine the best schedule for you, based on your family history and other reasons.\n4. Colon cancer screening:Colon cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. When you turn 45, your chance of getting it goes up. So unless you're at above-average risk, your doctor will probably recommend screenings once you reach that half-century mark.\nTests can help detect colon cancer early. How often you're screened depends on which tests you and your doctor decide you should have, and what the results are. Common screenings include:\nSigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy can also help prevent cancer. During these, your doctor may find and remove precancerous polyps from your colon.\n5. Pap test:This test checks for cervical cancer, which is easy to treat when caught early. Although your risk of cervical cancer goes down with age, your need for routine Pap tests doesnât stop with menopause.\nThe U.S. Preventive Services Task Force says women ages 21 to 65 should have a Pap test every 3 years. You could also choose to get screened every 5 years once you turn 30Â instead using human papillomavirus (HPV) testing or a combination of the Pap and HPV tests if both tests are negative the first time you take them. If you have a higher risk of cancer, you may need a Pap test more often. Your doctor can recommend whatâs best for you.\n6. Bone mineral density scan:This checks your risk for osteoporosis, a condition that weakens your bones. It's recommended for all women at age 65. If youâre at high risk, your doctor may want you to do it earlier.\nThis screening also may help men ages 70 and older.\n7. Abdominal aortic aneurysm screening:Experts say you should get this if youâre a man 65 to 75 whoâs smoked at any point in your life. Itâs an ultrasound that looks for an enlarged blood vessel in your abdomen that can cause severe bleeding and death if it ruptures. If your blood vessel is enlarged, surgery can often fix it.Â If you have a family history of this, talk to your doctor as they may recommend screening.\n8. Depression screening:Depression is a common cause of disability in adults, although itâs often overlooked. It can show up with chronic illness and aging. Itâs not a normal part of aging, and you can get treatment. If you're feeling sad, hopeless, or not interested in things you used to enjoy, talk with your doctor. They can see if you're depressed by having you fill out a questionnaire or by asking you a few simple questions.\n9. Diabetes screening:Nearly 10% of all Americans have diabetes, and nearly 28% of those are undiagnosed. Uncontrolled diabetes can cause complications such as blindness, kidney disease, and the need for limb amputation. Ask your doctor about how often you need diabetes screenings.\n10. Immunizations:As you age, you need a few extra vaccines to help you stay healthy, including:\nFlu shot:Folks 6 months of age and older should get one every year.\nPneumonia vaccine:A series of two different vaccines is now recommended. You should get them if you're 65 or older, and if you have:\nShingles vaccine:This is recommended if you're 50 or older.\nRemember, there's a lot you can do on your own to stay healthy as you age:\nSOURCES:\nAARP: \"What Health Screenings Do You Really Need if You Are Over Age 50?\"\nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality: \"Women: Stay Healthy at 50+.\"\nAmerican Diabetes Association: \"Diabetes Statistics.\"\nAmerican Psychological Association: \"Aging and Depression.\"\nAmerican Heart Association.\nAmerican Cancer Society.\nCDC: \"Leading Causes of Death.\"\nNational Cancer Institute: \"General Information About Colon Cancer.\"\nNational Institute of Mental Health: \"Older Adults: Depression and Suicide Facts (Fact Sheet).\"\nU.S. Preventive Services Task Force.\nPrevent Cancer Foundation: \"Frequently Asked Questions: Exactly what is a 'pre-cancerous' polyp?

        "Sept. 11, 2024 â You may have been warned thatÂultra-processed foodscan wreak havoc on your health. But not all of them are created equal.Â\nA newÂstudyÂout ofThe Lancet Regional Health â Americaslooked at different types of ultra-processed foods and found that some were even linked with lower risks ofÂcardiovascular disease,Âcoronary heart disease, andÂstroke.Â\nâAvoiding all ultra-processed foods is not practical for most people,â said Dariush Mozaffarian, MD, a cardiologist, public health scientist, and director of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University. âSo, it is helpful to start to understand, within the category of all processing, what food might be more or less harmful.â\nResearchers analyzed food questionnaires from three large groups of U.S. adults, with most people in their review being White and female. The study found that sugary and artificially sweetened drinks, along with processed meats, were linked to a greater risk of cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease. But cereals, savory snacks, and yogurt and dairy-based desserts were linked to a lower risk of these diseases. Ultra-processed cereals and breads were also linked to a lower stroke risk.Â\nâWe know that sugar-sweetened beverages are associated with metabolic derangement for things like higher glucose levels,Âinsulin resistance, visceralÂobesity,Âprediabetes,Âdiabetes, andÂhigher triglycerides,â said Ashish Sarraju, MD, a cardiologist with the Cleveland Clinic. âAdded sugars associated with all of those things are in turn risk factors for heart disease.â Sugar-sweetened beverages are often very high in sugar, artificial colors, and other additives, and almost ânothing beneficialâ in terms of ingredients, Mozaffarian said. âThey're also consumed in very high doses, very quickly.â\nProcessed meats have 400% higher levels of salt, compared to unprocessed meats, said Mozaffarian. They also contain high levels of addedÂnitrates, which are a carcinogen (a substance that can cause cancer) that could also affect the heart and blood vessels. Certain ultra-processed foods, such as bacon, are often fried at sky-high temperatures, which can triggerÂinflammatorycompounds.Â\nâIf you put together the inflammatory effects, the salt, and the nitrates, this is a package of food that can really build to cause harm,â said Mozaffarian. The World Health Organization has alsoÂclassifiedprocessed meats (bacon, ham, salami) as a group one carcinogen, he noted.\nâProcessed meats are typically high in saturated fats, sodium, and preservatives, which can increase blood pressure, promote inflammation, and negatively affectÂcholesterollevels, leading to a higher risk of coronary heart disease, said Joseph A. Daibes, DO, an interventional cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital. âThe study underscores the importance of limiting these types of foods to reduce cardiovascular risk.â\nBut considering that breakfast cereals â albeit highly processed â are a top source of whole grains for Americans, it makes sense that they are linked with lower risk of heart disease, said Mozaffarian.Â\nâThey have fiber, bran, whole grains, and they also have sugar, and additives,\" he said. âBut on average, putting all those things together, this study suggested that the net effect is beneficial. That doesn't mean they couldn't be more beneficial if we made them less processed, but they don't seem to have harm.â\nThe activeÂprobioticsand fermentation in yogurt can make it a healthy snack of choice, as there has been more and more research showing that fermented foods with probiotics are good for heart health and work against metabolic disease, or a cluster of conditions that can increase the risk of stroke, heart disease and type 2 diabetes, Mozaffarian said.\nSavory snacks, cereals, and yogurt and dairy-based desserts may also be less calorie-dense than sugary beverages and processed meats, said Daibes.Â\nâAdditionally, the type of fat used in savory snacks and the presence of probiotics in yogurt may have neutral or even positive effects on heart health, as opposed to the harmful fats and additives found in many ultra-processed foods,â he said.\nHow Ultra-Processed Foods Can Harm Your HealthÂ\nThere are âclear and concerning linksâ between eating ultra-processed foods and getting heart disease, according to Daibes. âIn real-life clinical practice, it's a rather clear and straightforward relationship â the patients who tend to have poorer diets, with more ultra-processed and nutrient-barren foods, tend to have worse health outcomes, both cardiovascular and otherwise,â he said.\nProcessing foods is centered on breaking down the natural structures of foods, as well as the loss of their natural nutrients, Mozaffarian explained. When you include the word âultra,â this refers to putting in industrial additives.\nâI think refined starches (such as wheat, corn, and rice) and sugars are some of the biggest harms because it leads to a big spike in blood glucose,â Mozaffarian said. âBut also, those refined starches and sugars are digested so quickly in the stomach and small intestine that you starve your gut bacteria in your large intestines.âÂ\nMany âgood-for-you ingredients,â such as fermentable fibers and bio-active compounds, are found in unprocessed, whole foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans, and seeds, noted Mozaffarian. High levels of salt in ultra-processed foods are another cause for concern, as are other additives such as artificial flavorings, sweeteners, and thickeners.Â\nOpting for Whole Foods\nThere may be people looking to eat cleaner, unprocessed foods, but high cost and a lack of access to them could create challenges. Sarraju advises his patients to simply do their best to eat foods in their whole-ingredient form and avoid pre-packaged foods as much as possible.\nSOURCES:\nAshish Sarraju, MD, cardiologist, Cleveland Clinic.\nDariush Mozaffarian, MD, cardiologist; director, Food is Medicine Institute, Tufts University.\nJoseph A.

Plus, hormone changes mean lower muscle mass, slowed metabolism, and creeping weight gain.\nHow can you fight back? With exercise. You donât need to live at the gym, either. All you need are just the right activities and a keen motivation. Bonus: You may even get relief from menopause symptoms like mood swings and sleep issues.\nStrength training isnât about bulging biceps. Aim for toned, strong muscles so you can do everyday tasks.

Do it least two days a week. Plan on 8-10 different exercises. Aim for at least one set of 8-12 reps for each, with a couple of minutesâ rest in between.\nTip.Circuit workouts, where you move quickly between different exercises, give you strength training and cardio in one shot.\nAerobic exercise -- especially working out hard enough to speed up your breathing -- is key for heart and lung health. If your bones and joints are strong, you might try:\nExercises that put less stress on your joints include:\nShoot for at least 30 minutes of moderate activity 5 days a week. You can even break it up into 10-minute chunks. Check your level of effort: You should have enough breath to be able to have a conversation, but not sing.\nTip.Build cardio into your day. Take the stairs. Walk your dog. Even yardwork, gardening, and fast-paced housework count.\nGreater flexibility means healthier muscles, better balance, and less joint pain. Good choices include:\nItâs good to stretch every day, but start with at least 2 days a week.\nTip.Build it into your exercise routine by stretching after every aerobic and strength workout. Couple it with deep-breathing exercises to help lower stress and hot flashes from menopause.\nThis is a common fear among older women.

        "Sept. 27, 2024 -- âWeekend warriorsâ â those who only exercise on the weekends -- may be getting the same health benefits as people who scatter their workouts throughout the week.Â\nResearchers at Massachusetts General Hospital looked at health data for about 90,000 people in the United Kingdom who wore wrist accelerometers, or motion tracking devices, that recorded their total physical activity and when they did it.Â\nPeople in the study, published Thursday in the medical journalCirculation,were categorized as weekend warrior, regular, or inactive, with inactive people recording less than 150 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.\nThe research team examined health records for connections between physical activity and occurrences of 678 conditions across 16 types of diseases, including mental health, digestive, neurological, and other categories.Â\nThey found that people classified as weekend warrior or active had similarly lower risks for over 200 diseases compared with people classified as inactive.Â\nThe benefits were especially strong for conditions like high blood pressure, with a 23% and 28% lower risk over an average of 6 years for weekend warriors and regular exercisers, respectively, and diabetes, with the study showing a 43% and 46% lower risk, respectively. But the benefits were found among all conditions studied.\nâBecause there appears to be similar benefits for weekend warrior versus regular activity, it may be the total volume of activity, rather than the pattern, that matters most,â co-senior author Shaan Khurshid, MD, a faculty member in the Demoulas Center for Cardiac Arrhythmias at Massachusetts General Hospital, said in aÂnews releasefrom Massachusetts General Hospital.\nKhurshid said the benefits of weekend exercise in lowering the risk of issues with the heart and blood vessels were already well known. The study shows weekend workouts can cut the risk of many other conditions, ranging from âchronic kidney disease to mood disorders and beyond,â he said.\nA study published in August inNature Agingfound that weekend warriors and regular exercisers had a similarly lowered risk of brain and mental health conditions, such a depression and anxiety.\nSOURCES:Â\nCirculation:âAssociations of âWeekend Warriorâ Physical Activity With Incident Disease and Cardiometabolic Health.â\nMassachusetts General Hospital: âWeekend Warriorâ Physical Activity May Help Protect Against More Than 200 Diseases.â\nNature:\"Accelerometer-derived âweekend warriorâ physical activity pattern and brain health.\"\n\n\n\nÂ© 2005 - 2024 WebMD LLC, anInternet Brandscompany.

        "You have a lot of say-so in how you feel as you grow older -- from your heart and eyes to your skin and bones.\nYou can enjoy a better body by knowing whatâs natural as you age and whatâs not and by learning simple steps you can try to delay or lessen the changes.\nAs you get older, your blood vessels and arteries become stiffer. Your heart has to work harder to pump blood. This can lead to high blood pressure and other heart problems.\nTry this: Stay active. Walk, run, swim -- even a little moderate exercise each day can help you stay at a good weight and keep your blood pressure down.\nEat lots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains to keep your heart healthy.Â  Manage stress. Get enough sleep. 7 to 8 hours of rest each night can help repair and heal your heart and blood vessels.\nYou might notice that your skin feels drier and less supple than it once did. Thatâs because your skin makes less natural oil as you age.\nAlso, you sweat less, and you lose some of the fatty tissue just below the skin. This can make it seem thinner.\nYou may also notice wrinkles, age spots, and skin tags, or tiny growths of skin.\nTry this:Hot water dries skin out, so take warm baths and showers.\nWear sunscreen and protective clothing when youâre outdoors. Check your skin often and tell your doctor if you notice changes, such as moles.\nIf you smoke, this is another good reason to try to stop. It can cause wrinkles.Â ÂÂ\nYou may find it hard to focus on objects up close. You might need reading glasses for the first time. Perhaps you see more glare or find it hard to adapt to abrupt changes of light.\nWhen it comes to your hearing, you could have a hard time following conversations in a crowded room or hearing at high frequencies.\nTry this:Get your vision and hearing checked regularly. Wear sunglasses to protect your eyes outdoors. Wear earplugs to protect against or block loud noises.\nYou might notice your gums seem to pull away from your teeth. Some medicines make your mouth feel drier. Dry mouth might put you at higher risk for tooth decay and infections.\nTry this: Each day, brush twice and floss once to get rid of food and plaque between your teeth. Itâs the best way to help prevent gum disease and tooth loss.ÂAlso, see your dentist for regular checkups and cleanings.\nAs early as your 40s and 50s, your bones begin to weaken. They become less dense and more brittle. This increases your risk of fracture.\nYou might even notice you seem to be shorter. In fact, beginning in your 40s, you might get shorter by 1 to 2 inches. That happens when the disks in your spine shrink.Â\nYour joints might feel stiffer. Fluid and cartilage that line the joints can decrease or wear away with age. As the tissues between your joints break down, you may develop arthritis.\nTry this: Make sure you get enough calcium and vitamin D. Good sources of calcium in your diet include dairy products, almonds, and vegetables such as broccoli and kale. Your doctor may also recommend calcium supplements.\nVitamin D is vital to bone health because it helps the body absorb calcium and maintain bone strength.. Some people are able to get enough of this nutrient by spending time in sunlight. You can also get it from tuna, sardines, egg yolks, and fortified foods such as milk and many cereals. Ask your doctor whether you need a supplement.\nYou might find it harder to control your bladder. This is called âurinary incontinence.â It happens to an estimated 10% of people 65 or older.\nMany of these people get a little leakage when they cough or sneeze, but some lose a large amount of pee before they can get to the bathroom. Â For women, menopause can be a factor. For men, an enlarged prostate might be the issue.\nYou might also notice that youâre not as regular as you used to be. Some conditions, such as diabetes, can slow down your bowels. Some medicines might make you constipated. These include medicines that treat blood pressure, seizures, Parkinson disease, and depression. Iron supplements and narcotic pain medicines can also lead to constipation.\nTry this: If you get the urge to âgoâ a lot, see your doctor. In most cases, symptoms can be controlled or even cured.\nTry to avoid caffeine, alcohol, sodas, and foods high in acid. These can make the condition worse.\nKegel exercises can tighten your pelvic floor muscles and may help with bladder control. Squeeze as if youâre holding your pee. Wait five seconds, then relax for five seconds. Do this four or five times in a row several times a day.\nTo avoid constipation, eat plenty of high-fiber foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Drink lots of water. Try to exercise every day. It can help get your bowels moving.\nAs we age, we lose muscle mass, and that can lead to weakness and reduced activity.\nTry this: Get some moderate exercise every day, such as a brisk walk or lifting light weights. It will help with muscle strength and function. Check with your doctor to see how much activity is right for you.\nEat lots of fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins such as fish and chicken. Stay away from sugar and foods that are high in saturated fat. And eat smaller portions. You probably donât need as many calories as you once did.\nDuring menopause, a womanâs vaginal tissues become drier, thinner, and less elastic. It might make sex less pleasurable. Breasts lose tissue and fat and can seem smaller and less full.\nAs men age, they may find it harder to get or keep an erection. This may be due to other health conditions as well as side effects of treatments.\nTry this: Talk to your doctor. They can prescribe medications to ease physical symptoms or ramp up your desire for sex.\nWe canât turn the clock backward. But with patience, care, and smart lifestyle changes, we can make the most of our bodies as we age.\nSOURCES:\nMayo Clinic: âAging: What to Expect.â\nNational Institutes of Health Medline Plus: âAreas of Age-Related Change.â\nUniversity of Cincinnati College of Nursing: âAging: Age-Related Physical Changes.â\nMerck Manual: âChanges in the Body With Aging.â\nAmerican Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: âEffects of Aging.â\n\n\n\nÂ© 2005 - 2024 WebMD LLC, anInternet Brandscompany.

        "Omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fats (or \"healthy fats\") you have to get from foods or supplements because your body doesn't make them. They're part of the support structure of every cell in your body; they give you energy; and they help keep your heart, lungs, blood vessels, and immune system working the way they should.\n\nThere are three main types of omega-3s:\nNot only does your body need omega-3 fatty acids to function, it also gets tons of health benefits from them, including those that support your brain and heart.\nHeart health\nSome research shows that eating fish high in omega-3s may reduce your odds ofcardiovascular diseaseby lowering your cholesterol and triglycerides (fats in your blood). But taking fish oil supplements doesn't seem to have the same benefits. In fact, one large study ended early because fish oil supplements actually raised participants' chances of having atrial fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat that can cause a stroke.\nAutoimmune diseases\nOmega-3s in fish and fish oil supplements may help with symptoms of several autoimmune disease like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and Crohn's disease. But we need more research to understand how they work and if omegas-3s from fish are better than those in supplements.\nDepression\nSeveral clinical trials have studied how well omega-3s work in helping people who aren't getting relief from antidepressants. A meta-a-\n+ nalysis of different studies found that omega-3s can help relieve some symptoms ofdepression. But more research is needed because some of the studies had mixed results.\nBrain development in infancy\nYou need to get plenty of omega-3s while you're pregnant for your growing baby. It's important for their brain development and future thinking and reasoning skills.\nAsthma in children\nA diet high in omega-3s lowers a child's chances of having symptoms of asthma from indoor pollutants. Researchers suggest kids are better protected when they eat more foods with omega-3s and less of those with omega-6 fatty acids, like soybean and corn oils.\nSymptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\nResearch has found that children diagnosed withADHDhave low levels of omega-3 fatty acids in their blood, particularly DHA. Other research also shows that fish oil might improve the symptoms of ADHD in some children, but more research is needed and omega-3 supplements should not be used as a primary treatment.\nCognitive decline\nSome research suggests that omega-3s may help protect against cognitive decline, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia and have a positive effect on gradual memory loss linked to aging. But studies suggest you get the most benefit when your diet is full of omega-3s before symptoms set in.\nWhen possible, try to get your omega-3 fatty acids from foods rather than supplements.\nFish high in omega-3s\nAim to eat nonfried, oilyfishhigh in DHA and EPA at least two times a week. Here are several:\nWhile eating more fatty fish is good, some are likely to have higher levels of mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, or other toxins. These include bigeye tuna, mackerel, wild swordfish, tilefish, and shark.\nVegan sources of omega-3s\nBear in mind that oils and nuts can be high in calories, so eat them in moderation.\nThe National Institutes of Health suggests you eat about 1-1.5 grams of omega-3 fatty acids every day as part of a healthy diet. It's best if it comes from food rather than supplements. You can get more than enough from a 3-ounce filet of fresh salmon.\nThere isn't much research on the symptoms of omega-3 deficiency. Most focus, instead, on how omega-3s benefit your health.\nBut if you don't get enough omega-3s in your diet, you could have rough, scaly skin or a red, itchy rash.\nOmega-3 deficiency isn't very common in the U.S.\nTalk to your doctor first before you take any supplements. They may have specific recommendations or warnings, depending on your health and other medicines you take.\nThe FDA doesn't regulate supplements for effectiveness, and research showsfish oilsupplements don't help lower your chances or heart disease. But that doesn't mean they might not not help relieve symptoms of other conditions.\nThe most common side effects from fish oil are indigestion and gas.\nOther side effects include:\nPhoto Credit:Generative AI by Getty Images\nSOURCES:\nAmerican Heart Association: \"Fish, Levels of Mercury and Omega-3 fatty acids.\"\nRonald Glick, MD, medical director, Center for Integrative Medicine, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.\nErminia M.

        "Sept. 13, 2024 -- âWe humans are, if anything, not very nice to ourselves.â\nThatâs a pretty strong summation, courtesy of clinical psychologistJoseph Galasso, PsyD, of what holds back many people from being who they want to be, achieving what they want, and in general finding happiness in this world of ours.\nThatâs why itâs useful for every single one of us to consider what just transpired in Paris: 4,400 athletes competed in the 2024 Paralympic Games, all of them in the top echelon of human accomplishment, and all of them every single day figuring out how to improve their already world-class performance.\nWhat can they teach us non-Olympians?\nWell, consider also the wide spectrum of competitors, both their type of impairment and its origin.Â While people with congenital disabilities (that is, ones they are born with) are generally assumed to be better adapted than people with acquired disabilities, emerging research isnât so clear.\nA new2024 studyshowed that athletes from either category had an equal shot at medaling. âââIn most of the sports we analyzed, there are no indications that either origin has a competitive advantage over the other,â says lead researcher Cecilia Severin, PhD. âThat doesnât necessarily mean that the origin of impairment has no effect at all, but it is likely that individual differences between the athletes â in training, preparation, equipment â have a larger effect on performance.âÂ\nWhen you think about it, this conclusion is actually far more inspiring -- and relatable. The Paralympic athletes at the top of this year's podium weren't destined or advantaged because they were \"born with it.\" No matter their unique circumstances, each and every athlete had to overcome enormous obstacles to master something that did not come easily.Â\nAccording to Galasso, an array of psychological mechanisms that help high achievers reach their goals were on full display at the Paralympic Games. âWe can learn so much from this group of athletes who compete because theywantto,â he says. âThat drive is universal.âÂ\nWhatever your goal, here are five powerful takeaways.Â\nNo. 1: They Acknowledge Their Limitations\nListen to a Paralympian talk about their disability, and youâll likely notice a common theme: No avoidance or excuses; no pity or angst. Typically, itâs just a neutral, matter-of-fact âyeah, this is the way it is.âÂ\nJust like you wouldnât expect Simone Biles to feel awkward or apologetic for her 4â8â stature, Team USA Paralympics athlete Max Rohn says the same goes for his physical limitations. âThereâs nothing wrong with a disability,â hepreviously toldreporters. âItâs just different challenges that you have to beat. In my case, I do have a right leg thatâs missing below the knee. I do have to deal with all these different problems during the day that deal with mobility.â\nThat acceptance isnât apathy. Just the opposite in fact. Galasso says itâs an incredibly adaptive skill that we all should strive for. âWhen we can look at our limitations â whether they are physical, mental, or skill-based â without judgment, we are better able to remain resilient in the face of adversity,â he says. (It also boosts our general quality of life by helping us to ditch the emotional baggage that self-judgment brings.)Â\nCanât seem to stop beating yourself up over perceived shortcomings? Galasso suggests journaling or meditation with one caveat: No self-judgment allowed. This allows for focus and objectivity in the moment. âMindfulness is a wonderful practice which helps us move through adverse situations without attaching judgment,â says Galasso.\nNo. 2: They Push Past âImpossibleâ by Thinking CreativelyÂ\nRememberthat scenein Apollo 13 when the team had to invent a way to purge dangerous levels of carbon dioxide from the capsule using nothing but duct tape and spare parts? That same kind of passionate ingenuity is what parasports are all about.Â\nâThe Paralympic Games are a wonderful opportunity to showcase the creativity of people with disabilities,â saysKathleen Bogart, PhD, professor of psychology at Oregon State University and co-founder of Disability Advocacy and Research Network (DARN).\nTake Sheetal Devi, 17, who was born with phocomelia, a rare congenital disorder that resulted in her arms not fully forming. Hitting perfect 10s in the final set to win bronze in the team archery event, she became Indiaâs youngest Paralympic medalist â and currently the only female archer to shoot without arms. Thatâs right, with the help of her coaches, Devi has successfully embraced an unconventional shooting technique: using her legs and feet.Â\n\nThink about that next time you convince yourself something âcanât be done.â\nNo. 3: They See Potential No Matter Where They Are on Their Timeline\nWhen it comes to physical fitness, itâs easy to feel held back by the long studied and generally accepted science of peak performance. After all, if youâve already passed your prime days for building speed or power or muscle, whatâs the point? You already know the outcome. Right?Â\nWell, consider the story of Manuel Bortuzzo. At 19 years old, the promising young Italian swimmer â on track to make the Olympics â was shot, causing a spinal cord injury that paralyzed half his body. In a sport that tends to reward youthful energy and explosive power, that should have been the end of his elite swimming dreams.\n\nNow 25, Bortuzzo won bronze in the 100m breaststroke (SB4 category) at the Paris Paralympics â and heâs just getting started.Â\nâIt's about adapting to your disability and finding the most efficient way,â Bortuzzo previously toldOlympics.com. âThe world No.1 in my specialty is much older than me, but when I first competed against him, I realized how early I am in my career and how far I am from those levels because it takes years of experience.\"\nMaybe the I-could-go-pro days are behind you, but thereâs far less of a cap on your ability than you likely believe.\nNo. 4: They Know Failing Is Different From Being a Failure\nAfter 13 years of competing at the elite level, Team USA sprinter Hunter Woodhall finally nabbed his first Paralympic gold. âAll of my other shortcomings prepared me for this,â hewroteon Instagram after winning the menâs 400m (T62 category). â[Trust] the process and time in the process. Dreams do come true, sometimes they just take a while. Keep fighting.âÂ\n\nBy accepting (rather than bemoaning) our obstacles and limitations, we can more quickly find a solution. By believing a solution is possible, we are more likely to stick with our goal. Are you seeing how all these chips start to stack up?\nResearch links persistence with what experts call a âgrowth mindset,â or the belief that your abilities and talents can improve over time through effort and learning, Bogart says.Â\nâItâs important to note that the healthy kind of persistence involves flexibility, not rigid stubbornness,â she says.Â\nFailure is feedback that we can (and should) learn from. To help keep that feedback positive and productive, it's important to pay close attention to your words and thoughts. When struggling with a new task or skill, remind yourself that you just havenât mastered it âyet.â Change your approach and try again.\nâListen to the voice that nurtures your willingness to try,â says Galasso, âthat tells you to go back to the next practice, that understands there will be growing pains.âÂ\nNo. 5: They Find Their PeopleÂ\nResearchÂ has in fact shown that people with congenital disabilities may fare better than those who acquire a disability later in life. âItâs something I call the congenital advantage,\" says Bogart.Â\nBogart and other experts believe itâs tied to whatâs known as disability self-concept, which encapsulates a person's disability identity and disability self-efficacy (i.e., their confidence in managing symptoms and tasks).Â\n\"People with congenital disabilities go through their initial development and form their identities alongside their disability, all at a time when they are the most cognitively flexible,â Bogart explains. âPeople who acquire their disability must adapt to a changed identity and relearn how to function and navigate in the world, putting them at a disadvantage.\"Â\nSo why doesnât that advantage seem more obvious at the Paralympics? Simple. Thereâs a powerfully effective antidote: support.Â\nâAnyone participating at the Paralympic level has likely had access to disability communities or coaches who have helped build up their disability self-concept to a high level,â says Bogart.\nâAny time you enter a new stage in life, community will become all the more important,â she continues. âStudies have shown that strong social connections contribute to resilience and overall life satisfaction. In creating them, we not only enrich our own lives but also create a ripple effect of support in the lives of those around us.âÂ\nMost of us are far more likely to âacquireâ a new identity â maybe as a parent, an aging athlete, a cancer patient, a retiree. Finding mentors who have lived in that chapter longer can help you adapt faster. Peer-to-peer counseling has also been shown to boost both self-esteem and drive for self-accomplishment.Â\nâBy feeling understood, you don't feel alone, and by not feeling alone, you find the strength to move forward,\" Bortuzzosays.\nSOURCES:\nKathleen Bogart, PhD, professor of psychology, Oregon State University; co-founder, Disability Advocacy and Research Network (DARN).\nJoseph Galasso, PsyD, clinical psychologist; CEO, Baker Street Behavioral Health.\nCecilia Severin, PhD, senior researcher and para-research coordinator, Centre for Elite Sports Research, Norwegian University of Science and Technology.\n\n\n\nÂ© 2005 - 2024 WebMD LLC, anInternet Brandscompany.

        "Oct. 3, 2024 â Ethan Weiss, MD, was already sold on intermittent fasting by the time he began studying it.Â\nFor 7 years, the cardiologist practiced a type of fasting known as time-restricted eating. He ate whatever he wanted each day from noon to 8 p.m., and he fasted the other 16 hours.Â\nBut once he started researching the topic, his thinking changed.Â\nThe University of California San Francisco researcher and his colleagues published aÂ12-weekÂstudy that foundÂno significant difference in weight lossbetween people who practiced time-restricted eating and those who ate a traditional breakfast, lunch, and dinner.Â\nBy then, Weiss was no longer following the diet or encouraging others to use it.Â\nâIt worked OK for me at first,â he said. But his family, he added, âwas very happy I stopped. I am nicer now.â\nOver the pastÂquarter-centuryas obesity rates rose,Âintermittent fastinghas emerged as one of the most popular diets in the U.S., thanks in part to research touting its extraordinary weight loss and health benefits.Â Just this week, aÂstudygrabbed headlines with the finding that time-restricted eating coupled with nutrition counseling led to greater reductions in body fat and better blood sugar control than nutrition counseling alone in adults with metabolic risk factors like belly fat and high blood pressure.Â Ina recent survey,about 13% of Americans on a diet reported using intermittent fasting.Â\nThe appeal is clear. You donât have to count calories, cut carbs, or eat like someone from a bygone era. In fact, you can eat whatever you want, as long as you consume it within a limited daily window.Â\nâPeople like it because itâs so easy to incorporate into your lifestyle,â saidÂKrista Varady, PhD, a professor of nutrition at the University of Illinois Chicago whoâs studied intermittent fasting since 2005.\nHer research shows that people who practice intermittent fasting usually eat less overall. In her 2024 study,Âpeople with obesitycut about 200 to 550 calories per dayÂ â without counting a single one.Â\nThat can lead to some serious weight loss, which often leads to meaningfulÂhealth improvements.Â\nBut other recent research shows mixed results.\nOne study from August found aÂheightened risk of cancer cell growth in micewhen they were refed after a fast.Â\nEarlier in the year, a poster presentation at a scientific conference reportedÂhigher rates of diseases of the heart and blood vessels among people whose eating habits resembled intermittent fasting.Â\nDoes this mean fasting diets are dangerous? Thatâs a hard no, and weâll explain why in a moment. But despite what enthusiasts have long argued, they may not be uniquely effective for weight loss and disease prevention, either.\nFasting and Weight Loss\nFastingâs weight loss and health-promoting reputation was built on studies of mice.Â\nThatâs also where Varadyâs research began. But she and her colleagues quickly moved on to studying intermittent fasting in humans.Â\nâMice are just not good models for fasting,â she said. âThey have really, really high metabolic rates. If you fast a mouse for a day, thatâs like fasting a human for a week.â\nAt first, Varady saw intermittent fasting as an improvement over more traditional approaches to dieting. âWhat I noticed was that people just really hated tracking calories all the time,â she said. âThey also didnât like having to restrict themselves every single day.â\nVarady and her colleagues tested the effects of alternate-day fastingÂ â eating about 25% of their normal diet one day and whatever they wanted the next.\nâBut then we slowly realized people also hate that diet,â she said. Thatâs when her research pivoted to the 16:8 approachÂ â 16 hours of fasting and 8 hours of eating. \"It seemed like a natural progression to study the one people actually do.â\nThe results of those studies, which by now have included thousands of people, show a consistent pattern: Improvements in health markers and reductions in disease risk are driven by people eating less and losing weight.Â\nâIf you donât lose weight, you donât see any health benefits,â she said.\nPotential Health Risks\nSo what about those recent reports connecting intermittent fasting to health risks?Â\nThe first was a poster presentation at a scientific conference sponsored by the American Heart Association. (In other words, it was not a published study in a peer-reviewed journal.) It looked at self-reported nutrition data from a large sample of American adults and identified a very small groupÂ â just 414 out of more than 20,000Â â who said they completed all their meals within an 8-hour window.Â\nCompared to people who reported eating windows of 12 to 16 hours, they were 91% more likely to die of heart disease during at least 8 years of follow-up.\nNo one could say if they accurately reported what and when they ate, whether they were demographically different from other people in the data set, or even if their eating pattern was a deliberate choice.\nDespite those limitations, the American Heart Association promoted the presentationâs findings in aÂnews release, leading to extensive news coverage and aÂscathing responsefrom 34 nutrition scientists, including Varady.\nThe study linking intermittent fasting to a higher cancer risk was very different.Â\nScientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that, in mice,many of the health benefits donât actually come from fastingâ but rather from the refeeding after a fast. When mice ate again after a fast, their bodies activated stem cells to repair and regenerate damaged tissues. That repair process, which includes theÂremoval of damaged or dysfunctional cells, is considered a major benefit of intermittent fasting.\nBut there is a potential downside: Cancer cells were more likely to multiply during the refeeding periodÂ â at least among mice that were genetically engineered to be more cancer-prone.\nHow does that apply to a human who practices time-restricted eating or alternate-day fasting?Â\nIt doesnât.Â\nâYou can find links to almost anything good and anything badâ with any diet, Weiss said. But he has yet to see any evidence thatÂintermittent fasting is harmful.Â\nOn the contrary, previous animal experiments have found aÂlower cancer risk linked to fasting.Â\nAnd preliminary research in humans suggestsÂimprovements in metabolic health and brain functionwith 5:2 intermittent fastingÂ â eating normally for 5 days, and then restricting yourself to a single meal on the other 2 days.\nIn that study, people in the fasting group were compared to a matched group who ate what the authors described as a âhealthy living dietâ 7 days a week for 8 weeks. Both groups achieved the same metabolic benefits, while the 5:2 fasting group did slightly better in tests of thinking skills.\nFasting Myths\nOne challenge with any diet is separating myth from fact.Â\nWith fasting, for example, advocates will often say thatÂgoing long periods without foodwas a natural part of human evolutionary history. Thatâs true, and itâs why our bodies today areÂmetabolically flexibleÂ â we can function on just about any kind of food, or with no food at all.\nBut it doesnât follow that humans, ancient or modern, routinelychoseto go without food, beyond specific religious practices.Â\nDuke University anthropology professorÂHerman Pontzer, PhD, has spent a lot of time with theÂHadza, a traditional hunter-gatherer community in Tanzania.\nâMy observations don't align with the idea that extended fasts are a normal part of life,â Pontzer said. âIt's very rare that there's not something to eat.â\nOn the other side of that coin is the notion that fasting is so unnatural, it causes harm. Varady is sometimes asked to comment onÂfalse narratives.\nÂ âThe main one that really bothers me, and the one that gets a lot of traction on the internet, is that intermittent fasting messes up peopleâs reproductive hormones, particularly in women,â she said. âI donât know how that got started, but thereâs literally no research in humans showing any clinically significant changes in any hormone like estrogen.âÂ\nItâs part of a bigger challenge faced by nutrition scientists as well as doctors, nutritionists, and other practitioners.Â\nâThe only thing people really listen to is random influencers on social media and what they think about intermittent fasting,â Varady said.Â\nAnother myth: Fasting gives people license to eat unhealthy foods during their feeding periods.Â\nThe idea seems intuitive, especially for more extreme versions of intermittent fasting. For example, if someone has just fasted for 24 hours, or if their feeding window is just 4 hours a day, youâd expect them to race to the drive-thru the minute that window opens.Â\nâInterestingly, they donât,â Varady said. âPeople donât want to switch out all the foods in their pantries. So they eat the same foods, but less of them. We donât see any increases in sugar or saturated fat intake.â\nHow to Make IntermittentÂFasting Work for You\nIf you decide to try it, Varady recommends 16:8 intermittent fasting.Â\nâThe 8-hour window is a good place to start,â she said. âIt results in some of the nicest weight loss weâve seen, and itâs one of the easiest to incorporate into someoneâs lifestyle.â\nIt also helps to go into it with realistic expectations.Â\nâIntermittent fasting results in mild weight loss,â Varady saidÂ â basically what youâd expect from any diet. âIt just helps people eat less. Itâs not magical.â\nSOURCES:\nEthan Weiss, MD, cardiologist, University of California San Francisco.\nKrista Varady, PhD, professor of nutrition, University of Illinois Chicago.\nHerman Pontzer, PhD, anthropology professor, Duke University.Â\n\n\n\nÂ© 2005 - 2024 WebMD LLC, anInternet Brandscompany.

        "Sept. 17, 2024 â People ingest tiny, chemical-containing bits of things that touch the food and drink we consume every day. There are a vast number of sources of these chemicals, ranging from plastic bags and bottles to take-out containers and shrink wrap to manufacturing and cooking equipment.\nScientists have identified 14,000 distinct chemicals that come into contact with food, and now a new study has established that 3,601 of them have been detected in the human body. That works out to be 25% of known food contact chemicals, sometimes called FCCs.\nAmong the worrying aspects of their findings was just how little is known about most of the chemicals, particularly if or how they affect human health. The researchers also found many that are already linked to cancer, permanent genetic changes, toxic effects on the reproductive system, and toxicity to essential body organs.Â\nSome FCCs are very well understood. One of the most well-known ones is bisphenol A (BPA), which has been banned from use in some containers like baby bottles due to health concerns that have prompted many products to advertise that they are âBPA-free.â Other chemicals have started being regulated further by the Environmental Protection Agency, including a handful of per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) inÂdrinking water.\nThe researchers also found metals, pesticides, volatile organic compounds that can be breathed in, and phthalates, which are used to make plastic, as well as fragrances and personal care products. The chemicals have technical names like triphenylphosphine oxide and di-n-propyl phthalate.Â\nWhen the team searched scientific literature to see what is known about the FCCs detected in humans, they concluded there is a broad lack of knowledge, such as for synthetic antioxidants that help keep products fresh and for oligomers, which are simply small molecules unintentionally added to food.\nâMany of these FCCs have hazard properties of concern, and still others have never been tested for toxicity,â the researchers wrote as to why they undertook the study. âHumans are known to be exposed to FCCs via foods, but the full extent of human exposure to all FCCs is unknown.â\nThe study,Âpublishedthis week in theJournal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology, comprehensively searched biological data collections for detections of FCCs in humans, such as from samples of blood, urine, skin, and breast milk. The data is now assembled and available in aÂpublic listingwith an interactive search tool.\nâOur research helps to establish the link between food contact chemicals and human exposure, highlights chemicals that are overlooked in biomonitoring studies and supports research into safer food contact materials,â lead author Birgit Geueke, PhD, senior scientific officer at the Food Packaging Forum, said in aÂnews release.\nSOURCES:\nJournal of Exposure Science and Environmental Epidemiology: âEvidence for widespread human exposure to food contact chemicals.â\nCBS News: âEPA announces first-ever national regulations for \"forever chemicals\" in drinking water.â\nFood Packaging Forum: âNew FPF study and database: Food contact chemicals in humans.â\n\n\n\nÂ© 2005 - 2024 WebMD LLC, anInternet Brandscompany.

        "Oct. 9, 2024 â For more than a century, steady increases in life expectancy sparked hope that humans may regularly live past the age of 100 someday.Â\nBut a new analysis now suggests that peak human longevity is well below that of becoming a centenarian. The findings,Âpublishedthis week in the journalNature Aging, show that the best typical lifespan for most women will be around 90 years old and just under 85 years old for men.\nCurrent U.S. life expectancy is 80 years old for women and 75 years old for men, according to theÂCDC.\nThe new predictions are based on data from the U.S. and Hong Kong, plus eight countries with long lifespans: Australia, France, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.\nâMost people alive today at older ages are living on time that was manufactured by medicine,â said lead author S. Jay Olshansky, PhD, a University of Illinois Chicago professor of epidemiology and biostatistics, in aÂnews release. âBut these medical Band-Aids are producing fewer years of life even though theyâre occurring at an accelerated pace, implying that the period of rapid increases in life expectancy is now documented to be over.â\nThe study authors noted that it is possible that a major breakthrough in medicine or science could change the currently decelerating trajectory of life expectancy. The results of such a breakthrough would likely have to overcome the effects of aging.\nOlshansky noted that extending life expectancy further could be harmful because the added years may not be healthy years.\nâWe should now shift our focus to efforts that slow aging and extend healthspan,â he said, meaning that focus should be on the number of healthy years lived.\nThe probability of living to age 100 is 5% for women and just under 2% for men, the new analysis showed. Hong Kong has the greatest likelihood of people living to 100 years old, where nearly 13% of women and more than 4% of men are predicted to become centenarians.\nAmong those who should consider the updated life expectancy predictions, the authors wrote, are âinsurance companies and actuarial firms tasked with forecasting mortality improvement factors. These impact current carriers of life insurance and also the valuation of current and future insurance applicantsâ policies.â\nThe authors concluded that âhumanityâs battle for a long life has largely been accomplished.â\nBut, they added, what that longevity looks like may be drastically different in the future.\nâGiven rapid advances now occurring in geroscience, there is reason to be optimistic that a second longevity revolution is approaching in the form of modern efforts to slow biological aging, offering humanity a second chance at altering the course of human survival,â they wrote. âHowever, until it becomes possible to modulate the biological rate of aging and fundamentally alter the primary factors that drive human health and longevity, radical life extension in already long-lived national populations remains implausible in this century.â\nSOURCES:\nNature Aging: âImplausibility of radical life extension in humans in the twenty-first century.â\nUniversity of Illinois Chicago: âDespite medical advances, life expectancy gains are slowing.â\nCDC: âLife Expectancy.â\n\n\n\nÂ© 2005 - 2024 WebMD LLC, anInternet Brandscompany.
