## Project Overview

The **Viitalink Voice Assistant** is a voice-enabled AI application designed to improve the interaction between seniors and healthcare technology. This app focuses on supporting senior users as they manage their medical needs by using voice recognition to capture, process, and log their responses. The assistant provides feedback both audibly and visually, creating a user-friendly experience for seniors.

Key features include:  
- **Multi-language support** for English, Chinese, Spanish, and Korean, tailored to meet the needs of our diverse senior user base.  
- **Casual conversational style** for health assessments, ensuring users don’t feel like they’re participating in a formal medical evaluation.  
- **Data collection** through natural conversations, providing insights into physical and mental health.  
- **Smart reminders** for medications and doctor appointments, with future improvements aimed at reducing manual data input.
